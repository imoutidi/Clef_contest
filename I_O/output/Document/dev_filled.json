They wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery. But, little did they know that they were soon to go on an exciting adventure.\nThe sun burned bright, almost burning up their bodies. Megs, Sandhya and Rohan sat under the shade of the tree. There was no breeze.\n“Let's go down to the stream,” suggested Rohan. “At least the water will be cool.”\nAt the stream was a a girl around their age. She smiled.\n“What are you doing here?” asked Megs.\n“I have come to see the dolphins!” she replied.\n“Dolphins! Dolphins!” they laughed.\nThe girl was unfazed. When they finally stopped laughing she looked back at the river, and whistled. The water began to ripple and three beautiful, gleaming dolphins arched out of the water.\n“AAHHH!” exclaimed the three.\nThe girl waved at the dolphins and spoke to them. The dolphins swam up to the banks and it looked like they were having a conversation. After a time they swam off. The girl walked away.\nRohan tried a similar whistle but of course, nothing happened!\n“Come on,” said Megs, “let's catch up with her and find out how she brought the dolphins here!”\nThey ran down the path they had seen her go. They caught up with her as she was entering a cottage.\n“Hey! Hello! Wait up!”\nShe heard them and waited.\n“Listen, we are so sorry we laughed at you when you said you were waiting to see the dolphins. We had never ever seen dolphins there…” said Sandhya.\nThe girl smiled and said, “Why don't you come inside?”\nThey introduced themselves.\n“My name is Minu. Every summer, my dad and I go on a vacation. This year we chose this place!”\nJust then her father appeared. She introduced him as ‘Mr. K'! He wore very baggy trousers that were mended at the knees, a bright red shirt, and a shiny, velvet, black coat that hung down to his knees. He smiled and rubbed his hands in glee, seeing them.\n“So what can I get you children? I suggest some lovely herb tea. That's the best to beat the summer heat.” He disappeared into the kitchen. Very soon, he came traipsing out balancing a tray with three lovely thimble-sized cups — blue, green and red. “Now sip it very slowly. It is very potent and should be taken only in small quantities.”\n“What is your favourite book?” he asked.\n“Mine is Wizard of Oz ,” said Megs immediately.\n“I would say, my favourite is Moby Dick , but then I also like War Horse !” said Rohan.\n“Uh Ho! NO NO!,” protested Mr. K. “Only one book please.”\n“Okay then, I guess War Horse wins.”\n“Mine is definitely Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Flies Again !” said Sandhya.\nSuddenly, a great wind blew outside, howling against the cottage, rocking it and then everything seemed to disappear in the wind. Finally, after what seemed ages, when the wind died down they saw that they were in some unknown place. As they picked themselves up they saw a strange creature walking towards them. Every step he took he made a sound — very like the clanging of a tin can.\nMr. K said, “You can sing ‘Somewhere over the rainbow…'. I'll join in the chorus.”\nMegs began to sing, “Somewhere…” But then Megs was not a good singer, and her voice jarred and scraped at every nerve in the listeners and they were forced to make her shut up. Mr. K thought it very funny and laughed. Minu was not amused. While Mr. K was still laughing they heard the sound of gun shots. They took cover under the sparse undergrowth. The gun shots and the sound of war came closer. They heard the steady clip-clop clip-clop of horse's hooves. When they peered out of the bushes they saw a beautiful horse. Majestic in his bearing and proudly carrying an English soldier.\n“Wow! I don't believe this,” said Rohan. “This is Joey!”\nThe horse and rider came closer. Then all of a sudden he reared, throwing off the soldier and with nostrils flaring and his tail high in the air he charged towards where they were hiding.\nThey ran as fast as they could, but the horse was gaining on them. They could almost feel his hot fetid breath on their backs. Just when they thought they had met their end they heard the sound of a car. They glanced upwards and saw a rather strange looking vehicle bearing down on them. As it came close, it seemed to stretch out a hand and gather them all up.\nWithout even realising what had happened, they found themselves safely ensconced in the comfort of a car.\n“Hello,” said the man driving, “We are the Tootings. Join us for more adventure…”\nThe Tooting family cheered and shouted hello and the car went up and down. Far below they could see mountains and valleys, rivers and the sea.\nThen Mr. K snapped his fingers and they were back in his little cottage. The girl sat there tight-lipped and unsmiling. Mr. K was cheerful and happy.\n“Can I get you some more herb tea?” he asked, mischief lighting up his eyes.\n“No father, you will not!” said the girl sternly.\nMegs, Rohan and Sandhya looked at her doubtfully.\n“My father is a magician! He does this to all the people I bring home. They never visit again!”\n“Oh! But I think we will visit again,” said Rohan.\n“And again,” said Sandhya."}

The residents demanded that garbage, instead of being dumped at the dumping ground, be completely processed at the Plant. They further want that the dumping ground be shifted out of Dadumajra.\nThe residents and the members of the Dadumajra ward committee raised slogans against the Administration, Municipal Corporation and JP Associates who are running the Plant. The plant is producing around 30 per cent inerts instead of 10 to 15 per cent as per the detailed project report.\nDue to the inerts, the dumping ground is filling up at a faster pace than expected. This is creating problems for the residents of Dadumajra.\nArea councillor Kamlesh, who too participated in the dharna, said, \"The problem is not of the residents of Dadumajra alone. The stench can be experienced in many parts of the city.\"\n\"Harmful gases are being emitted from the plant. These are endangering the lives of residents across the city. There is a need for immediate action,\" he pointed out.\n\"The Municipal Corporation has been delaying action against the plant, due to which there has been no end to the problem. We will be sitting on dharna till some action is taken. Either the dumping ground should be shifted out or the plant should properly function,\" demanded Kamlesh.\nA resident of the area said that there is no drainage facility in the dumping ground. After it rains, water enters the colony or remains stagnant. It then becomes the breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies.\nApart from the inerts, there are certain kinds of waste that are not accepted by the plant. These include horticultural waste, vegetable waste and meat waste. This is also contributing to the filling up of the dumping ground."}

It’s nearly 1 pm and the no-frills restaurant is packed with customers. Among them are college students, women, politicians, Secretariat employees, office goers with their ties loosened, head-load workers in their distinctive blue shirts, families and even senior citizens, who you wouldn’t think could make it up the double flight of stairs. In the queue that stretches down the street, are dozens of others, even as the fragrance of freshly fried seafood wafts out of the kitchen tantalising senses.\nWhat’s drawn them all here is the restaurant’s signature (and only) dish — rice with fish fry\/curry, served on a banana leaf. It’s a classic, well-loved combo, a favourite of just about every true-blue Malayali, and has spawned a slew of similar eateries. Keeping the meal unique for the hungry hordes is P Salauddin, the genial 65-year-old owner of the joint.\nTo think that he started the business when he was 25, in a hut at the same spot selling tapioca and fish curry, primarily to small-time vendors and workers in the market, is hard to imagine. “The restaurant used to be called ‘chetta kada’ then, a chetta kudil in local parlance . Now, ‘chetta’ can also mean a lowlife in Malayalam. As the business flourished and I started being recognised on the streets, people started commenting, ‘De pokunnu chetta! (There goes the lowlife!). It was imperative that I give a proper name to the restaurant,” he says, with a guffaw. “Also, it was around the same time that I started paying tax, and it was necessary to give the restaurant a name.”\nOn the must-visit list\nThe thatched roof later became a tin roof, and today, the newly-renovated Mubarak Hotel, which can seat about 150, is the favourite dining destination for the city’s foodies, who don’t mind venturing deep into Ruby Nagar, a congested alley and slumming it out on metal stools (no, there are no chairs!) to dine. That the restaurant is on the must-visit list for visitors to the city is evident at the cashier’s table itself. It’s where Salauddin keeps his collection of currency notes, including Saudi Arabian riyals, Qatari riyals, UAE dirhams, Indonesian rupiahs, Thai bahts, Malaysian ringgits... and even a Ghanaian cedi and a Venezuelan bolivar or two. “The currency notes were given to me by my customers. Sometimes a note or the other takes the fancy of a collector or a customer and I let them have it. I know I’ll get more! I don’t like revealing who has dined here, other than to say, almost all celebrities have. If they can’t physically come to the restaurant, they order takeaway,” says Salauddin, while handing out the change and chatting with acquaintances.\n‘Freshness is our USP’\nThe restaurant’s USP, he says, is the freshness of its seafood. “We serve only the catch of the day. I personally buy it from local fishermen in Vizhinjam, Valiyathura, Vettukad and other nearby beaches. It’s straight from the sea to our kitchen, and the produce is not even kept on ice, to ensure it doesn’t lose flavour.”\nAs soon as a customer is seated, he gets a banana leaf onto which go a selection of vegetarian sides, plus a generous helping of steamed tapioca. Along with this are a couple of bowls of curry and a fish gravy. A customer gets to choose from at least eight varieties of fried fish — seer fish, tuna, trevally, anchovies, mackerel, pomfret, prawns and shrimp. Spicy and crisp, each is a wonderful example of traditional Kerala cooking.\n“Our aim is to bring out the natural flavour of the fish. As such, we have separate masalas for each variety. The basic marinade, however, is crushed ginger-garlic, egg, chilli, spices and yoghurt. Also, we deep fry the fish, just so that it’s nice and crispy on the outside and succulent and moist on the inside,” explains Salauddin.\nIn the evenings, the menu is limited, and there will only be ari pathiri or chappati and whatever is leftover from lunch, plus anchovy curry and fry. Time to go fishing!\nIn this weekly column, we peep into the histories of some of the most iconic restaurants\nThe restaurant used to be called ‘chetta kada’ back then, because we functioned out of a thatched-roof hut, a chetta kudil in local parlance\nP Salauddin"}

On August 31 alone, two days before Onam, Kerala bought IMFL worth Rs 34.13 crore.\nA season-on-season analysis showed a growth of 22.5 per cent in sales. The corporation's sales would have hit another high but for two dry days in the last week. The actual sale of IMFL would be much higher considering the bottles emptied in bars, which are outside the purview of the corporation's figures. Besides, the business of hooch is active in the state, especially in the coast and the hilly regions.\nIn the financial year 2008-09, sale of liquor touched Rs 4,627.83 crore from Rs 3,669.49 crore in 2007-08, registering a 26 per cent rise in business.\nTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With corporate social responsibility on mind, the Kerala State Beverages Corporation Limited is planning a super-specialty hospital with focus on de-addiction and trauma care. \"The corporation board had taken a decision in this regard and the proposal is pending before the government.

After a second visit to Tremseh on Sunday, the team said Syrian troops went door-to-door in the small farming community, checking residents' IDs and then killing some and taking others away.\nAccording to the UN, the attack appeared to target army defectors and activists.\n\"Pools of blood and brain matter were observed in a number of homes,'' a UN statement said.\nSyria denied UN claims that government forces had used heavy weapons such as tanks, artillery and helicopters during the attack Thursday.\nSyrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said the violence was not a massacre  as activists and many foreign leaders have alleged  but a military operation targeting armed fighters who had taken control of the village.\n\"What happened wasn't an attack on civilians,'' Makdissi told reporters Sunday in Damascus. He said 37 gunmen and two civilians were killed  a far lower death toll than the one put forward by anti-regime activists, some of whom estimated the dead at more than 100.\n\"What has been said about the use of heavy weapons is baseless,'' Makdissi added.\nThe UN has implicated President Bashar Assad's forces in the assault. The head of the UN observer mission said Friday that monitors stationed near Tremseh saw the army using heavy weaponry and attack helicopters.\nThe fighting was some of the latest in the uprising against Assad, which activists say has killed more than 17,000 people. Violence continued Sunday, with more clashes reported around the capital, Damascus."}

Whose team? | Delhi News - Times of India\nAug 20, 2001, 23:45 IST\nAug 20, 2001, 23:45 IST\nthe don was anything but. atleast off the field. on the field he was the king of the mafiosi, getting his way every time. slaughtering the opposition coldly, methodically, ruthlessly. but once retired, he was exemplary in his behaviour, never getting into controversies, never letting his legend descend into commercialism. which is why when he died more than 50 years after he had laid up his cricket boots, there was no diminishing of his legend. so when sunil gavaskar says that he doubts the authenticity of sir donald bradman's dream team, it isn't a case of sour grapes. first of all, gavaskar isn't a petty man. secondly, when bradman guarded his reputation so zealously all his life and made sure his name wasn't dragged into even the smallest scrap, why would he do so over such a frivolous thing as a dream team? and thirdly, why on earth would the don specify that the team's composition be released after his death as if it were a dreadful secret to be posthumously revealed? after all, a dream team is just that: a fun thing you sit with friends over a drink or two on a long evening and with the aid of an imaginary time machine, get the best players from every country and from every era together into the ``best ever'' xi. take ten experts or ex-cricketers (which often isn't the same thing) and you will get ten different teams in which only two names will be common. bradman, of course, and sir gary sobers because he was three cricketers rolled into one. a brilliant batsman who could bat in any position, a pace bowler and a first class spinner. all the other nine positions are up for grabs. let us suppose for a minute that bradman's dream team isn't just a brilliant marketing gimmick. (actually, it is. it will put roland perry's book bradman's best on all international best seller lists). but just suppose it isn't, and it was formulated by the don himself. how good, then, is the list? * here it is in batting order: arthur morris (australia), barry richards (south africa), don bradman (australia, captain), sachin tendulkar (india), gary sobers (west indies), don tallon (australia, wicket keeper), ray lindwall (australia), dennis lillee (australia), alec bedser (england), bill o'reilly (australia), clarrie grimmet (australia). 12th man: walter hammond (england). it's actually not very good. that's because it suffers from two very pronounced biases. there is, first of all, the australian bias. and second, there is ``my time was the best'' bias. out of the 12, there are as many as 8 who played in bradman's time. and out of the eleven there are as many as seven australians. and although bradman's own team of 1948 was dominant, the west indies team under clive lloyd ruled over the cricket world for longer, as has steve waugh's present team. and the english who invented cricket, were the best team for years and years. first, because they were first. and also because throughout the last 100 years, they have had some wonderful cricketers who were considered the very best in their era. yet, there isn't a single cricketer from the present australian team, although steve waugh, glen mcgrath and shane warne would be very strong contenders. and for my money, adam gilchrist is probably the greatest wicket-keeping all-rounder in history. there also isn't a single west indian from the all-conquering west indies team. here's a roll-call of names: lloyd himself, sir vivian richards, malcolm marshall, michael holding, andy roberts -- other west indians from different years who got left out include the three ws (everton weekes, clyde walcott, sir frank worrel), george headley, curtly ambrose, the world's leading wicket-taker courtney walsh and brian lara, the world record holder for tests and first class scores. from the english team of the whole century, bradman's teams includes only alec bedser (walter hammod is 12th man), omitting names like jack hobbs, len hutton and geoff boycott, all three openers of whom hobbs has been described as the most technically correct batsman ever, while hutton held the world record for highest score (364) till brian lara scored 375. then there is our own sunil gavaskar whose record as an opener is unparalleled, especially because he played through most of his career against really fast bowlers and did so while carrying the batting burden for a really weak team. you could argue that, in the end, a dream team is a subjective thing, and it is bound to reflect personal bias. even allowing for that bias, there is a serious problem with the team: it lacks balance. there are as many as five pure bowlers. bradman apparently said that ray lindwall could bat. but although he scored a test century, lindwall's career test batting average is only 21.15. when you consider wicket-keeper don tallon's batting average of 17.13, the dream team has a tail which begins at number six. why not have an all-rounder like keith miller, ian botham, mike procter, imran khan or kapil dev? the other is in having two leg spinners. o'reilly and grimmet may have had differing styles, but they were both leggies. wouldn't the attack be more balanced with an off-spinner? take your pick from jim laker, hugh tayfield, lance gibbs and muthiah murlitharan. given these flaws, you do wonder if bradman actually made that list. or if he did, whether it was something tossed off over a drink. let's plump for the second option and pour ourselves one too!"}

The academy, known to be a \"good mobiliser\" with \"poor control\" on the crowd, is allegedly responsible for 10 deaths during a protest against Salman Rushdie's controversial book Satanic Verses and another two in a firing during JJ Marg protest. In Bhiwandi, a law-and-order situation was once orchestrated by the group.\n-Mobilisation and propoganda material like press advertisements, Facebook links and hoardings outside mosques and video parlours were ignored. Urdu press advertisements placed from Thursday to Sunday, indicating a growing list of supporters, were overlooked.\n-Videography done by cops at Govandi and conveyed to control room was not taken seriously. The situation on trains and roads to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) was not taken seriously. Flags  possible weapons during riots  mounted behind two-wheelers were overlooked.\n-Two deputy commissioners of police  Port Zone and Security  entrusted with the task of additional support for bandobast have clarified that their roles were not defined."}

(AP)\nPlanning Commission is likely to cut the annual average economic growth rate target of 8 per cent for the 12th Plan (2012-17) to around 6 to 6.5 per cent in its mid-term review of the five year policy document.\n\"It would be difficult to achieve the 8 per cent average economic growth in the 12th Plan period in view of slowdown. It is quite possible that Commission will cut the target substantially to around 6 per cent,\" an official said.\nAs per the practice, the Commission comes out with a mid-term review of Plans during the third financial year of the policy period.\nIn its last mid-term review, the Commission had cut the annual average growth rate target of 9 per cent to 8.2 per cent for the 11th Five Year Plan period (2007-12). But only 8 per cent average annual economic growth was achieved in 11th Plan.\nReeling under the impact of slowdown, Indian economy grew by 5 per cent in 2012-13, the first year of the 12th Plan. The economic growth is expected to be flat this year. The first quarter (April-June) economic growth in this fiscal has slipped to 4.4 per cent from 4.8 per cent the previous January-March quarter.\nAccording to experts, with a presumption that the economic growth remains 5 per cent in first two years of the 12th Plan, the country has to maintain a rate of around 10 per cent in remaining three financial years of policy period to achieve the targetted 8 per cent which was not possible.\nThe Plan itself talks about the different growth scenarios. The document said that in absence of sufficient action to promote economy, the average growth would range from 6 top 6.5 per cent."}

He said the TDB would extend all possible support to the district panchayat project.\nMr. Gopalakrishnan said he would suggest that senior Ayyappa devotees visiting Sabarimala with coconut palm saplings plant them along the Thiruvabharanappatha instead of heaping them at the hillock.\nMr. Kondoor said that volunteers of Kudumbasree in the stakeholder grama panchayats, Nehru Yuva Kendra, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers, Ayyappa Seva Sanghom, and other devotees’ organisations would take part in the programme to plant 11,111 saplings along the path on a single day. He said Kudumbasree units in the area concerned would be entrusted with the task of nurturing the saplings for five years.\nRelated Topics"}

In a way, it is. This car has a new face, a new engine and a new price. When it is launched this month, it will be diving into a segment that has the Maruti Swift Dzire and the maxi-space Mahindra Logan.\nRedesigned\nThe bumper is redesigned, the headlamps and grille are new, and the hood is different too. Look at it from the rear, and it’s like meeting an old friend who’s wearing new glasses. You know something is different, but it’s hard to put a finger on it. That’s because the only changes at the back are the slightly redesigned tail-lamps.\nUnder the hood lies the biggest change. Ford has slipped the 1.4-litre TDCi engine from the Fiesta into the Ikon. The interiors will give Ikon fans a sense of déjÀ vu. Here, the only changes are the new dials and the beige colour scheme. From the driver’s seat, there’s good visibility outside. The driving position is comfortable – the chunky steering is a nice fit in your palms, the seat is well bolstered, and there’s good thigh support (if only the seat base was a bit longer, it would be perfect).\nTwist the key, and you’ll be greeted with a gravelly idle note. There’s a bit of vibration through the gear lever too.\nFord claims a big improvement in NVH (noise, vibration and harshness), but in reality, it isn’t much. You can hear the gravelly engine note at all times, even while cruising.\nOn the highway you will feel a bit short on power, but the car will happily cruise at 120 kph. At this speed, the engine is spinning at a frenetic 3000 rpm, so it is audible in the cabin.\nFord has tweaked the suspension settings. The ride is really good, the Ikon absorbing bumps with a nicely rounded edge and the suspension is very refined.\nFord is offering only one variant on the Ikon. If Ford can price it at Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 6 lakh, the Ikon would make a lot of sense. It is very driveable in city traffic and is ‘middle-of-the-road’ in the ride department. It handles well, still looks the most proportionate car in this class, and now comes with an engine that’s proven its fuel efficiency.\nOUSEPH CHACKO"}

It will also be home to the Navy’s submarine fleet in addition to having berthing facilities to accommodate as many as the 50-odd frigates.\nThe base will enhance the Navy’s operational flexibility and strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean region, including in anti-piracy efforts, a senior Ministry of Defence (MoD)official told Express. Actually, the move to set up an exclusive Naval base at Karwar is intended to decongest Mumbai on the West coast and Visakhapatnam on the East coast, as the two ports also have commercial shipping operations. Also, the decision was prompted by Mumbai’s proximity to Pakistan and the Islamic nation’s growing missile arsenal.\nKarwar will also get a new Naval air station from where maritime planes and helicopters, including combat aircraft, can operate.\nThese apart, Karwar’s existing Railway station will be upgraded and expanded to have a ‘siding’ for the Navy’s use.\nThe Naval base, when completed, will have over one lakh personnel working there, apart from their families living in an upcoming  residential township. Civilian facilities such as educational institutions, hospitals, recreational centres and a sports complex too form part of the region’s expansion plans.\n“The Karwar base has the facility to berth INS Vikramaditya, the erstwhile Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier, which is scheduled to join the Navy in the last quarter of 2013. The expansion will allow it to be home to two more aircraft carriers later,” the official added.\nThe 45,000-tonne Vikramaditya is currently undergoing refit in Russia and its delivery schedule was revised in September.\nApart from the one for Vikramaditya, Karwar will get two more jetties under Phase-IIA to berth the under-construction 40,000-tonne Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC), to be called INS Vikrant, and its follow-on warship, which could weigh around 60,000-tonnes.\nIt will also host the Scorpene submarines, once they are built by the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks Limited (MDL), and their follow-on submarines.\nBy the end of Phase-IIA in 2018, Karwar will be home to about 30 of the Navy’s 160 surface warships and submarines.\nPresently, the Navy has placed orders for 44 warships.\nIt will be inducting at the rate of five or six warships a year from now for another decade, to increase its fleet strength from the existing 145. And Naval chief Admiral D K Joshi had recently said the Navy will be inducting warships at a faster rate than it decommissions them.\nMeanwhile, for executing Phase II-A, the Navy is scouting around for global firms with the  necessary experience to successfully handle such a mammoth project.\n“We are in the process of hiring consultants for building the maritime and aviation military facilities at Karwar,” the official said, adding that six global consultancy firms had been shortlisted.\nAnother key facility will be the 10,000-tonne ‘ship lift’, the only one of its kind in this part of the world. And the facility will be expanded to add two or three dry and repair berths."}

They were led by the District Collector and the District Revenue Officer (DRO).\nThe temple entry followed an agreement reached at peace talks on Monday between Dalits and caste Hindus.\nArrangements were made for Dalits to offer special prayers early in the day. As the police and district administration officials waited outside the temple for their arrival, about 75 Dalits from Therkku Kaadu Dalit habitations were taken to the temple in vans escorted by police personnel.\nWomen and men jostled with one another as they crossed the threshold of the temple and walked towards the sanctum sanctorum with flowers, garlands and coconuts as offerings to the idol. As they craned their necks to catch a glimpse of the deity, the DRO and the Collector personally collected their offerings and passed them on to the priest in the sanctum sanctorum for special prayers.\nWhile community leaders, including Chettipulam panchayat president and vice-chairman of Vedaranyam Panchayat Union, waited at the entrance to felicitate officials including the Collector and DRO, officials stepped aside to personally usher in the Dalits into the temple.\nCollector C. Munianathan and DRO A. Annadurai personally served prasadam to every Dalit inside the temple after the prayers.\nLater, Mr. Munianathan expressed his unequivocal displeasure to the panchayat president and vice-chairman over the turn of affairs over the past fortnight. “Discrimination has no place,” he said.\nHe appealed to Dalits to function normally without any fear and assured them of all administrative support. Police personnel would be stationed in the area for a few more days to ensure normalcy.\nVillagers other than Dalits were absent at the temple. Most of the men were said to be on the run following a crackdown by the police after the violence of October 14.\nAbhay Kumar Singh, Deputy-Inspector General of Police, Thanjavur Range; Maheshwar Dayal, Superintendent of Police, Nagapattinam; Praveen Kumar Abinabu, Superintendent of Police, Tiruvarur and Rajendran, Revenue Divisional Officer, were among those present.\nRelated Topics"}

One second, it’s humid, and the next, rain is everywhere, and it’s all wonderful and cool. But your skin doesn't seem to think so. Here are some easy ways to calm yourself, your skin and your hair... a Sunday at home pamper routine if you will.\nTackle that skin\nHoney is everything. Be it skin or hair, it’s a wonder product. I love using honey on any areas that are getting heat boils or even blemishes. Since it’s anti-bacterial, keeping it on for 15 to 30 minutes calms your skin down. It also helps sooth those itchy patches caused by constant sun exposure.\nAnother wonder product is sugar or sea salt. Use it as a scrub, especially on those blackheads, and around the nose and chin where your skin tends to clog up most.\nLastly, always moisturise. No matter what, keep your skin hydrated. If a store-bought moisturiser isn’t for you, try aloe vera or almond oil (or a combination of them).\nKeep makeup light\nThis is a general rule for summer, but keeping your makeup light around the year will also ensure it looks very natural. And if you ever run out of time and walk out of the house bare-faced, there won’t be too much of a difference. Over moisturiser, I like to spot-conceal. This basically implies that you use a tiny amount of concealer over places that really need it (under the eyes, scarring, pigmentation, blemishes etc) and pat it in with a clean finger. I like to go over it with a loose powder or a loose powder foundation, but apply it using a wet sponge. This, once again helps the powder sink into the skin and look natural. It also allows your bare skin to breathe and still look like itself. This way, be it sweating buckets or having buckets of water being poured down your face, your makeup will not give you away.\nHair nourishment\nI always find that hair tends to get frizzy during this time of year, no matter what a person does. You can use all the conditioner you want, but unless your hair has been treated, chances are, this weather will cause it to frizz. A simple solution to this? Argan oil. There are so many products (more often priced ridiculously) where argan oil is the main ingredient. Instead of spending your money on them, I would suggest getting pure cold-pressed argan oil (www.mokshalifestyle.com). This oil is so nourishing and moisturising that a little bit (not more than a couple of drops) can tame the frizziest of hair.

Then there was similar misfortune in Madhya Pradesh's Panna Tiger Reserve in February 2009 — the wild cats became extinct there.\nSariska led the way soon by reintroducing tigers under a recovery plan with the support of the National Tiger Conservation Authority in June 2008.\nPanna followed suit in March 2009. It reintroduced one female each from Bhandavgarh and Kanha. Thereafter, it appears, both the reserves charted their own journeys.\nThe Panna experiment turned out to be a big success. The 576-sq.km reserve, spread over Panna and Chattarpur districts of Madhya Pradesh, soon became home to a flourishing population of big cats. The reserve, 25km from Khajuraho, once ravaged by problems, has now 12 tiger cubs, besides the five adults brought in as part of the reintroduction. And that gives Sariska, the leader, a complex, for its three tigresses are yet to give a litter.\nThe tale of the two reserves came in for comparison this weekend at Alwar when the main protagonists of the tiger reintroduction process got together to discuss the rebuilding of Sariska.\n“Where there is a will there is a way,” said R Sreenivasa Murthy, Field Director in the Panna Tiger Reserve, giving a presentation on tiger relocation and their successful breeding.\nThe Panna story included the truancy of the lone male, which apparently showed “homing” instincts to repeatedly move in the direction of Pench — it had to be brought back with the help of 70-strong forest staff and four elephants for a second time.\nThe Panna experiment did not stop at just reintroduction. The park authorities opened a new chapter in conservation by introducing two orphaned female cubs to the reserve in March 2011. They were the litters of a collared tigress that got killed in a fight with another in Kanha in May 2005. They were picked up and hand-reared for one-and-half years to be released into an enclosure in Kanha.\n“The Panna team met with success in the rewilding of the tiger. One of them, T4, delivered cubs in November 2011,” said Mr. Murthy.\nMr. Murthy and H.S. Pabla, who retired last year as the Chief Wildlife Warden of Madhya Pradesh, said they did their part and left the rest to the tigers.\n“In Sariska, females ST2 and ST3, showed signs of pregnancy but no litters were produced. The cause of not breeding is not known,” said K. Sankar, scientist with the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehra Dun, who has been part of the Sariska experiment. “There appears to be no disturbance to the tigers. The prey density is one of the best in the country. However, the human habitation inside the park surely is an obstacle. In fact, the Sariska tigers have only 50 sq.km in the 882-sq.km reserve for themselves.”\nWhile some experts, including Sunayan Sharma, president of the Sariska Tiger Foundation, which organised the workshop, felt that the radio collars around their necks might be hampering the breeding, others emphatically dismissed it as inconsequential. “There is no connection between the radio collar and breeding,” said Dr. Sankar.\n“We have consulted the NTCA and they are of the opinion that collars cannot be the reason,” said U.M. Sahai, Head of the Forest Force, Rajasthan.\nWhat made all the difference in Panna? “I have no explanation why tigers are not breeding in Sariska and they do in Panna,” said Mr. Pabla.\nHis suggestion to the Rajasthan authorities in this connection included introduction of breeding tigresses — instead of virgins — and not to have too many males around. Mr. Murthy said the presence of elephants in Panna was of great help to tigers.\nMoreover, Panna had an advantage of not having any village inside.\nRaghuveer Singh Shekhawat, Field Director, Sariska Tiger Reserve, is confident of a breakthrough in the reserve.\n“What is all this fuss about litters? We need to leave certain [things] for the tigers to decide,” said Samir Sinha, author and head of TRAFFIC India.\nRelated Topics"}

He also was influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches, the book says, before finally having surgery in July 2004.\nIsaacson, quoting Jobs, writes in the book: \"'I really didn't want them to open up my body, so I tried to see if a few other things would work,' he told me years later with a hint of regret.\"\nJobs died Oct. 5, at age 56, after a battle with cancer.\nThe book also provides insight into the unraveling of Jobs' relationship with Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google and an Apple board member from 2006 to 2009. Schmidt had quit Apple's board as Google and Apple went head-to-head in smartphones, Apple with its iPhone and Google with its Android software.\nIsaacson wrote that Jobs was livid in January 2010 when HTC introduced an Android phone that boasted many of the popular features of the iPhone. Apple sued, and Jobs told Isaacson in an expletive-laced rant that Google's actions amounted to \"grand theft.\"\n\"I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,\" Jobs said. \"I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.\"\nJobs used an expletive to describe Android and Google Docs, Google's Internet-based word processing program. In a subsequent meeting with Schmidt at a Palo Alto, California, cafe, Jobs told Schmidt that he wasn't interested in settling the lawsuit, the book says.\n\"I don't want your money. If you offer me $5 billion, I won't want it. I've got plenty of money. I want you to stop using our ideas in Android, that's all I want.\" The meeting, Isaacson wrote, resolved nothing.\nThe book is clearly designed to evoke the Apple style. Its cover features the title and author's name starkly printed in black and gray type against a white background, along with a black-and-white photo of Jobs, thumb and forefinger to his chin.\nThe biography, for which Jobs granted more than three dozen interviews, is also a look into the thoughts of a man who was famously secretive, guarding details of his life as he did Apple's products, and generating plenty of psychoanalysis from a distance.\nJobs resigned as Apple's CEO on Aug. 24, six weeks before he died.\nDoctors said Thursday that it was not clear whether the delayed treatment made a difference in Jobs' chances for survival.\n\"People live with these cancers for far longer than nine months before they're even diagnosed,\" so it's not known how quickly one can prove fatal, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.\nDr. Michael Pishvaian, a pancreatic cancer expert at Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, said people often are in denial after a cancer diagnosis, and some take a long time to accept recommended treatments.\n\"We've had many patients who have had bad outcomes when they have delayed treatment. Nine months is certainly a significant period of time to delay,\" he said.\nFortune magazine reported in 2008 that Jobs tried alternative treatments because he was suspicious of mainstream medicine.\nThe book says Jobs gave up Christianity at age 13 when he saw starving children on the cover of Life magazine. He asked his Sunday school pastor whether God knew what would happen to them.\nJobs never went back to church, though he did study Zen Buddhism later.\nJobs calls the crop of executives brought in to run Apple after his ouster in 1985 \"corrupt people\" with \"corrupt values\" who cared only about making money. Jobs himself is described as caring far more about product than profit.\nHe told Isaacson they cared only about making money \"for themselves mainly, and also for Apple — rather than making great products.\"\nJobs returned to the company in 1997. After that, he introduced the candy-colored iMac computer, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad, and turned Apple into the most valuable company in America by market value for a time.\nThe book says that, while some Apple board members were happy that Hewlett-Packard gave up trying to compete with Apple's iPad, Jobs did not think it was cause for celebration.\n\"Hewlett and Packard built a great company, and they thought they had left it in good hands,\" Jobs told Isaacson. \"But now it's being dismembered and destroyed.\"\n\"I hope I've left a stronger legacy so that will never happen at Apple,\" he added.\nAdvance sales of the book have topped best-seller lists. Much of the biography adds to what was already known, or speculated, about Jobs. While Isaacson is not the first to tell Jobs' story, he had unprecedented access. Their last interview was weeks before Jobs died.\nJobs reveals in the book that he didn't want to go to college, and the only school he applied to was Reed, a costly private college in Portland, Oregon. Once accepted, his parents tried to talk him out of attending Reed, but he told them he wouldn't go to college if they didn't let him go there. Jobs wound up attending but dropped out after less than a year and never went back.\nJobs told Isaacson that he tried various diets, including one of fruits and vegetables. On the naming of Apple, he said he was \"on one of my fruitarian diets.\" He said he had just come back from an apple farm, and thought the name sounded \"fun, spirited and not intimidating.\"\nJobs' eye for simple, clean design was evident early. The case of the Apple II computer had originally included a Plexiglas cover, metal straps and a roll-top door. Jobs, though, wanted something elegant that would make Apple stand out.\nHe told Isaacson he was struck by Cuisinart food processors while browsing at a department store and decided he wanted a case made of molded plastic.\nHe called Jonathan Ive, Apple's design chief, his \"spiritual partner\" at Apple. He told Isaacson that Ive had \"more operation power\" at Apple than anyone besides Jobs himself — that there's no one at the company who can tell Ive what to do. That, says Jobs, is \"the way I set it up.\"\nJobs was never a typical CEO. Apple's first president, Mike Scott, was hired mainly to manage Jobs, then 22. One of his first projects, according to the book, was getting Jobs to bathe more often. It didn't work.\nJobs' dabbling in LSD and other aspects of 1960s counterculture has been well documented. In the book, Jobs says LSD \"reinforced my sense of what was important — creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could.\"\nHe also revealed that the Beatles were one of his favorite bands, and one of his wishes was to get the band on iTunes, Apple's revolutionary online music store, before he died. The Beatles' music went on sale on iTunes in late 2010.\nThe book was originally called \"iSteve\" and scheduled to come out in March. The release date was moved up to November, then, after Jobs' death, to Monday. It is published by Simon & Schuster and will sell for $35.\nIsaacson will appear Sunday on \"60 Minutes.\" CBS News, which airs the program, released excerpts of the book Thursday."}

No second gate has been provided, which is a clear security lapse. Doors are usually fitted on both sides (left and right in front and rear) of ferry boats, to ensure safety. There should be at least four doors, considering emergency situations,” said K Sivaprasad, HoD and associate professor at Department of Ship Technology, Cusat. In a statement issued here, Sivaprasad alleged that the design plan for conversion of barge into passenger ferry boat was accepted by the registering authority of the Port Department without following the conventional naval architectural practices.\n“Inland passenger ferry vessels should have a separate vertical keel, which helps  proper manoeuvring of the vessel while approaching the jetty.

When a new bridge comes up near it on the Kollam-Theni National Highway 220, the bridge built in 1903 will be closed to traffic.\nThe 96.20 meter-long-bridge is too narrow to accommodate two-way traffic. During peak hours, logjams are common on the bridge.\nTaking cognisance of these facts, a decision was made to construct a new bridge.\nUnlike other British structures in the district there is not much data available about this bridge. Vandiperiyar grama panchayat president G. Vijayanand says the bridge was built to ease traffic flow in the High Ranges after Kumily emerged a main town following the construction of the Mullaperiyar dam. Two roads constructed by the British during this period were the Kottayam-Kumily road and a road which was extended to Kattappana.\nOf the many bridges built using stone between Kumily and Kottayam, the Vandiperiyar bridge was the only one on which vehicles still plied. “Initially heavy vehicles carrying goods used the bridge, later it was thrown open to general traffic,” Mr. Vijayanand said.\nOther bridges like the ones at Kauntharuvi and Karinkulam Chappathu were replaced by new bridges. Karinkulam bridge still remains as a symbol of British architecture.\nThe government has decided to preserve the Vandiperiyar bridge as it was constructed over a century ago.\nWhen the construction of a new bridge was announced in the last State Budget, shopkeepers refused to cede land for it.\nLater, they relented and decided not to demolish the old bridge to make way for the new one, but to preserve it as a monument to the British era.\n“The bridge is an architectural wonder. The steel railings on either side of the bridge provide space for pedestrians to stand,” said Muthusami, a shop owner.\nRelated Topics"}

The first nine years of the millennium have given momentum to the science and technology programme in this country, and India’s achievements are charted and compared with those of China and Brazil.\nIf one were to look at the reply given by the government in the Lok Sabha, the expenditure on Research and Development (R&D) as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is lower than that of developed countries and a few developing countries like Brazil and China. But it has been increasing the S&T outlay of scientific departments\/agencies: from Rs 12,022 crore in the 9th Plan to Rs 25,243 crore in the 10th Plan. And there are plans to increase it further in the 11th Plan.\nYet India lags behind Brazil and China in innovation capacity even while it fares better in the quality of its scientific research institutions, according to the Global Competitiveness Report 2009-10, released by the World Economic Forum recently.\nGermany, Japan and Switzerland are at the top of the list. Ironically, we are ranked at 25, ahead of China (35) and Brazil (41). Innovation capacity and quality of research institutions are two key science indicators in a total of 12 that ranked countries according to the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). This is a clear indication that the scientific community needs to refocus its priorities and work towards a target and deadline. We need to overcome the shortcomings in higher education even though we have some of the best universities in the world. Our technological readiness remains a major challenge as most research work happening in the country seem to be done without a fixed target and deadline.\nMany senior scientists have expressed their frustration at not having all projects related to science and technology under one ministry.\nHaving based our policy on the structure left behind by the British, S&T comes under the Prime Minister under whom a chief scientific adviser and science advisory council function. The Prime Minister controls the ministry through the National Council on S&T. Then there is the Ministry of Earth Sciences, and Departments for S&T, Bio Technology etc. This apart, there are ministries and departments like Scientific and Industrial Research, Agriculture, Chemicals and Fertilizers, Non-conventional energy sources, Health etc which fund projects in various universities and laboratories. The one big question is about nanotechnology which is going to play an important role in every field where materials or molecules are involved. As the Indian Science Congress began at Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday, it is time the community discussed with the who’s who of S&T what ails Indian science."}

Congress minister Aryadan Mohammed was addressing the crowd at that moment in the presence of V M Sudheeran.\n“They tried to enter the stage forcefully and  tried to change the direction of the speakers. There were also efforts to attack a local cable channel cameraman. The festival was interrupted for almost one hour,” C Manoj Kumar, organising committee member of the fest, said.\nThere was also allegation that some of the Congress workers, who came to interrupt the fest, were in an inebriated state.\nHowever, the Congress leadership has informed that there were no such issues at the arts festival venue. KPCC member and also the chairman of UDF committee in Perinthalmanna Sethumadhavan said that the party workers had only pointed out the disturbance they were facing because of the noise from the arts festival venue.\nMeanwhile, the police have registered a case against the Congress workers, based on a complaint filed by the school authorities.\nThe party workers were also involved in a similar incident last Sunday when they manhandled a news channel cameraman while shooting the fighting of a few Congress workers outside the District Congress Committee office. V M Sudheeran took a major chunk of his time during the Yatra to condemn the CPM over the political violence its members were engaged in. But the attacks by Congress workers in Malappuram district have  tarnished him and the yatra.\nApart from this, the KPCC president was highlighting the need for women empowerment  through the journey.

Former Australian Open junior champion Yuki Bhambri ranked 346 in the world will take on Karol Beck of Slovakia, who is ranked 101 in the world.\nThe other wild card Vishnu Vardhan ranked 313 is pitted against Ivan Dodig of Croatia, who is ranked 36th in the world. The first match of the season is always tricky as players come from a lay off after taking a month’s break after a gruelling season. Some train hard during the off-season, while many start the season hoping to gain form before the Australian Open\nThere is a possibility for top players getting a bit rusty because of the break. This is one area Indian wild cards can hope to capitalise on. uki has been training hard and has also been to the US to polish his game.\nKarti Chidambaram, vice-president of AITA, said the other Indian players should take a leaf out of Somdev Devvarman’s book. Somdev reached the final of the 2009  Chennai Open as a wild card entrant. The question is do the Indian wild cards in this edition have it in them to do a Somdev?  It is difficult to match Somdev’s aggression and one should not forget he has the strongest pair of legs in Indian tennis.\nNevertheless, Yuki needs to enjoy his outing and be at his aggressive best. Vishnu is pitted against a seasoned pro Dodig. Vishnu is tall and athletic. Serve is his strength. “Serve is Vishnu’s strength. Plus his height will be an advantage. He\nis a more determined player now with good exposure in ITF tournaments. It all boils down to how aggressive he plays. Aggression is the only way to surprise a higher ranked opponent,’’ said Hiten Joshi, chief coach of TNTA.\nIt will be a dream come true for Mohit Mayur and Ramkumar Ramanathan, when they take the centre court to meet the experienced Israeli pair of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram. Both have made steady progress right from their sub-junior days to reach this level.\nFormer junior national champion Ramkumar, product of Triangle Tennis Trust, and Mohit Mayur have benefited from the coaching initiatives of TNTA. Both have trained abroad on a regular basis and have some knowledge of professional tennis.\nMohit trained in Germany recently, while Ramkumar trained in Spain and won a doubles tournament with different partner. Although the duo’s chances of making progress in the doubles look unlikely, they will become richer with the experience."}

Is wasabi the new black truffle? Is Wagyu beef the new caviar? Asian chefs are storming the world of international food, armed with the obligatory knowledge of French cooking techniques — which helps get a foot in the door — and then going on to rewrite the rules, inspired by century-old culinary customs, tried-and-tested family recipes and colourful traditional ingredients.\nFuelling all this is the increasingly adventurous Asian foodie, enthusiastic about experimenting with daring new foods and flavours, and yet fiercely loyal to ‘home' food. The newly launched Miele guide — a product, to declare my association upfront, I was in a way involved with — takes a look into the increasingly-dynamic Asian food scene. The annual guide, which attempts to showcase Asia's finest restaurants thereby promoting Asian chefs, food and flavours, seems to be becoming quite influential given it's only in its second year. One reason could be because of its novelty: Surprisingly Asia's never had a professionally produced independent guide of this sort. In fact, with its reputation for cheap, quick and delicious food, Asia for a long time was not even much of a contender on the cutting-edge fine dining scene, which has been dominated by France, California and lately Australia.\nThe 2009\/2010 Miele edition took into account opinions of food writers from every major region (80 in all) and the public leading to a shortlist of 2,200 restaurants. The final selection was based upon the over 98,000 votes cast from 98 countries, as well as the Miele's jury of 1,500 food professionals and journalists. The slim edition finally features about 450 restaurants.\nIndian flavours\nIndia does feature, but is overshadowed dramatically by China, Japan and Indonesia. While Indian food is undeniably sophisticated, the country's chefs seem to play it safe in comparison with their counterparts in Shangai, Tokyo and Singapore. Bukhara, the only restaurant that makes the top 20, is practically stodgy with tradition. Our chefs often say they're handicapped by the fact that customers don't appreciate experimentation with Indian food. However, to get attention like Heston Blumenthals, Ferran Adrias and Thomas Kellers of the world, innovation, creativity and presentation certainly need to go up several notches.\nAsia is best known for its boisterous dining and fuss-free food. But for fine dining, innovative ambience is key. After all a great restaurant should be an experience. Ku De Ta in Bali, leapt into No. 9 this year largely because of the drama of its architecture. While the guide says the food is good, it admits the restaurant stands out because it's “a scene and one of the best on the world” with its “fantastically good-looking clientele, great sounds and sexy interior theme.”\nTweaking fresh, local ingredients with international twists seems to be another way Asian chefs are turning heads. At Iggy's, the top restaurant, Wagyu strip loin is served with watercress lightly tossed in piquant Japanese goma (sesame) dressing. At Mozaic in Bali, there's pan fried foie gras paired with sweet and sour young Balinese starfruit broth. At Laris, in Shangai, David Laris chef-proprietor calls his food ‘contemporary, which signifies a freedom from ethnic labels.' His Australian-Greek heritage, grounding in French classics, experience in Macau, Hong Kong, Hanoi come together to create food like a coriander laced mussel stir fry.\nAsia's strength has always been traditional recipes, passed on for generations. And judging by Hong Kong's Yung Ki, (exulting in food such as roast goose, tea smoked pork belly and platefuls of tiny rice birds), which comes in at No. 10, staying true to your roots certainly pays off long-term. However experimentation is what keeps dining exciting. Vietnam's top five restaurants, for instance, all feature chefs who are exploring ways of recreating Indo-Chinese and global cuisines with subtlety and flair.\nIndia's top five celebrates our rich culinary heritage. But then that's a laurel we've always had. Perhaps it's time our undeniably brilliant chefs stop resting on it.\nRelated Topics"}

Drama is evoked right away, the reader robbed of warm-up time and all along fed those little dramatic doses.\nWhat began as an idea for a short film for this “prematurely balding and seemingly malnourished writer” who works as a film editor to pay his bills, finally found its full voice in the format of a play. Under the Chestnut Tree travels through art censorship, artistic rivalry and notions of morality, but does so with a touch of wit. Here colours are rebellion, so each artist’s canvas is a play in black and white. And each in his\/her own way works around this censorship on creativity.\nThe subject is vastly different from what Akash has done earlier.

The playwright has done children’s plays before taking a different step with Mahua — a love story that opened the Writer’s Bloc 3 Festival last year.\nUnder the Chestnut Tree , a satire that teases the idea of a physical context or a time frame, is a new attempt from Akash. “I was just creating a world taking inspiration from actual and historical events and seeing how people behave in a totalitarian State.

It wasn’t an easy journey; the director had written various scripts and bounced off ideas to filmmakers, without much success. Some of his projects got cancelled after coming close to taking off. Naturally, he is quite emotional as his film Middle Class Abbayi (MCA) starring Nani and Sai Pallavi releases this month. He talks of his producer Dil Raju, his core team and technicians who stood by him when there were initial hiccups as the project continued. He appears calm, composed and is brimming with positivity as he talks about his film. “Nani liked MCA instantly, he seemed to fit into it perfectly.You will be able to make out the difference from the rest of the roles he had done before.”\nSpeaking about the inspiration to the film, Sreeram says, “The idea germinated when I moved to Hyderabad with my brother and when I got married. The story is from a purely personal experience. Rest of it is fiction. My brother is my hero and we were very close, stayed together in the city before my wife came into my life. I noticed the small and tiny insecurities in him and found it really cute. I selected a script which is not completely out of the box and also something that not many have worked on. It has a nice screenplay.”\nThe trailer which released shows Nani moving to Warangal with his sister-in-law (Bhumika) who keeps harassing him with household chores.Bhumika Chawla returns to the big screen after a long time. Their relationship is sure to evoke laughter and will also bring in an element of seriousness. The director concurs, “If good content is complemented with a better casting, it will surely help the film. Bhumika was my first choice. I had to make her wait one entire day for only a single scene being shot on her, but she was so understanding.”\nHe adds, “The conflict point in the film is simple, how we understand, misunderstand and misinterpret relations. Despite the egos and misunderstandings amongst family members, I tried not portraying it as a melodrama.”\nSo is his brother aware of the plot? “My brother is clueless, he saw the trailer and remarked mana katha laga undi . I said, ‘Not really, wait till you watch the film’.”\nHe terms Sai Pallavi as the best part and entertaining part of MCA . When he signed her, Fidaa had not released. He admits of getting tempted to make her speak Telangana again as the setting is in Warangal but he resisted it. Most of the films in recent times like Arjun Reddy, Fidaa and parts of Pelli Chupulu had the artistes talking in Telangana dialect, which is why the director chose to do away with it.\nThe reason for choosing Warangal as a backdrop is for a visual difference, he says. It is a historical place with a unique texture — the rocks, the old buildings and most of the visuals haven’t been used in films. Also he is very familiar with its topography. He avers, “I wanted it to be shot in a town. There is a different kind of emotion that comes from a village and there is a different emotion from the city. One fights for bread, other for spaghetti. We wanted to capture the essence of those emotions.”\nSreeram adds, “I am the story writer but I am assisted by two talented dialogue writers, Thiru and Sreekanth. It is a blessing to have Sameer Reddy handle the camera. We shot on roads and real locations and his experience helped me. Devi Sri Prasad had given all crowd-pleasing numbers and the lyrics are a reflection of my thought process, especially the first song.”\nThe idea germinated when I moved to Hyderabad with my brother and when I got married. The story is from a purely personal experience. Rest of it is fiction.\nRelated Topics"}

Mysoora Reddy called off his two-day roadside protest against the Government's decision to fence off the only passage leading to his house in Banjara Hills here on Monday, following an appeal made by party president N. Chandrababu Naidu.\nThat the Government's move smacked of political vendetta could be gauged from the fact that it has fenced off a 100 yard passage and put up a \"Trespassers will be prosecuted\" board, leaving out the abutting vast three acre Government land worth Rs. 100 crores, Dr. Reddy told presspersons.\nHe accused the Government of granting exemption from Urban Land Ceiling Act and \"gifting\" away this three-acre land to an individual Madan Mohanlal Sriram for building a hotel in violation of the existing rules. He said the Government had issued 180 GOs granting similar exemptions involving 250 acres of prime land in and around the city, worth Rs. 1,000 crores and demanded a judicial inquiry into the \"scam\".\nWhile appealing to Dr. Reddy to call off his protest, Mr. Naidu charged the Congress Government with developing a dictatorial streak, seen in the way it was liquidating TDP leaders and workers, stifling the voice of the Opposition and filing defamation cases against Opposition leaders and the media.\nThe action was politically motivated as Dr. Reddy got an assurance from the Revenue and Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad officials to use the passage till the sump, which was there on the portion he had given away for road widening, was shifted and the access ramp to the house laid.\nThis was before he left for Kadapa but on the same night, barbed wire was installed and a board put up.\n\"Obviously the officials were acting on the orders of the political leadership.

Sundaramurthy said Fr.Thaninayagam was a scholar who exalted Tamil at the world level. “Youth should understand the need for emulating such hard work.” Mr.Sundaramurthy also reiterated the words of another Tamil scholar who claimed Fr.Thaninayagam was an icon of the Tamil language. He also pointed to Arignar Anna’s words describing the contribution of Fr.Thaninayagam to Tamil. “Fr. Thaninayagam traced many Tamil manuscripts at libraries across Europe.”\nTamil scholars Avvai Natarajan, Kaviko Abdul Rahman and vice-chancellor of SRM University M. Ponnavaiko were among those spoke.\nMany of the scholars reminisced about the contributions of Fr. Thaninayagam. Tamil festivals and such centenary celebrations also contribute to the growth of Tamil, said Professor Ponnavaiko. Celebrations of Tamil festivals spread to other parts of the world because of the efforts by Fr. Thaninayagam, who was professor and head of Indian Studies, University of Malaysia, from 1961 to 1969. When Oriental scholars met in Delhi in January 1964, Fr. Thaninayagam was instrumental in convening a meeting of the Tamil scholars. The International Association for Tamil Research organised the first International Tamil conference-cum-seminar in 1966 in Kuala Lumpur. Fr. Thaninayagam, hailed as the ‘Roving Ambassador par excellence of Tamil’ during his lifetime, learnt European languages such as Latin, Italian, French, Portuguese, German and Spanish. Fr. Thaninayagam, born on August 12, 1913, founded ‘Tamil Culture,’ a quarterly journal in 1952, and attracted scholars from foreign countries. His idea of inaugurating the International Association of Tamil Research received support from Tamil scholars of other countries.\nRelated Topics"}

Colours ranged from bright to earthy, with a few whites, neutrals and everything else thrown in; there wasn’t any discernable colour story.\nThere were a lot of interestingly patterned leggings worn under kurtas, making for interesting mixed prints. On the whole, it was a fairly average Joe collection.\nThe Highs: I loved the salwars with striped panels made of zari, brocade, sequins and velvet at the bottom. Very pretty, and perfect when worn with a simple kurta.\nThe Lows: Right at the end of the show, all the models came out wearing patterned churidars with Hyderabad Designer Week tees and chunni. Talk about a gimmick fail.\nWho: The showstopper, actress Navneet Kaur, was in a panelled kurta in shades of green and deep turquoise with a vshaped yolk at the neck, which she wore over a rich blue churidar.\nTheme: Nizam Kitsch What: The show featured a bevy of garments - mostly dresses - in brocade and raw silk in jewel, net and a whole lot of crystals fashioned into paranda-esque danglers that he used to embellish most of the garments. The garments were accessorised with jewelled hair adornments and beige shoes.\nThe Highs: I liked the high-necked blue dress in silk with a deep v-cut in the front and knife pleat detailing.\nThe Lows: The beige net fabric used was just plain ugly and unflattering. I didn’t like any garment with the netting.\nDesigner: Ishita Singh Theme: The Three Phases of a Woman What: The show was, as the theme suggests, divided into three distinct segments.\nThe first segments featured voluminous dresses in baby doll silhouettes, gypsy skirts with suspenders, tiered shararas and tops in decidedly Indian fabrics and prints in an earthy colour palette, accessorised with velvet jholas, and what appeared to be velvet socks. Very contemporary, very chic. The second segment featured most silhouettes from the first segment, only now they were in brighter colours, like lime green, bright pink and baby sky blue with fabrics like velvet, crochet and lace thrown in. There were also quite a few long kurtas worn over skirts. The third segment was built upon the first two. Only now the colour scheme was almost entirely in shades of white with a hint of gold and only a smattering of prints and colour. The accessories evolved too - geek glasses, kolhapuri style flats and neckpieces made out of rough finish beige cord.\nThe Highs: The first segment was undoubtedly the best I’ve seen in the Hyderabad Designer Week so far. I loved the earthy tones, the volume and the chic accessories.\nThe Lows: The second segment was a bit of a let down.\nWho: This show had two showstoppers -- Karishma Karne, Femina Miss India East and Ganesh Venkatraman, who was also hosting the show. Karishma Karne wore a wispy multi-layered skirt in white with a dull gold border and suspenders and a white top, which was accessorised with a thick white cottony neckpiece.\nGanesh Venkatraman was in an abstract print beige kurta and white churidar."}

How resonant are love letters in the age of SMSes and emails?\nI think in these emotionless times, when we have no time for each other, the personal touch is most required. Any day, human touch of a letter outweighs the touch of a button. This play tells people to head to the nearest post office rather than the closest cyber café.\nHow faithful were you to the original script?\nIn 1992 when we opened the play, we pretty much stayed with the original script – but we chopped out a lot of the references that we felt were too American. What we did however was to radically change the interpretation that the writer indicated in his preface. In his playwright’s note, he states quite emphatically that he doesn’t want the cast to move, no sets, no props, no music. We added all that much to his annoyance!!!\nWill there be any change of idiom for local tastes?\nNo we didn’t change the idiom. If I was directing the play today in 2007, I might have adapted to the Indian context.\nHow has ‘Love Letters’ changed from the first time it was staged about 14 years ago?\nNo ‘Love Letters’ hasn’t changed\nA lot of good theatre directors are moving on to films. How do you see this trend?\nYes. It is true, a lot of the present crop of theatre directors is moving into film, especially during this time of the small budget-multiplex film. A lot of intelligent directors, with stories to tell, feel that this a great time in our cinema history to make such films. So much has changed – we now have song-less films, where the running time is two hours and no hero-heroines dancing around trees – it is a time when if a good director has a story to tell, he will find both the money and the audience. I am also making my first feature film next year...\nAre there more people willing to pay to watch good plays now? As against before when serious theatre seemed to face a bleak future?\nYes, I do believe that the theatre going audiences have increased hugely.\nSmall budget, niche movies are a big rage now? Does this trend affect theatre-going audience?\nIn fact, because of the small budget niche movie, audiences are now prepared to watch serious plays.\nThe MetroPlus Theatre Fest is presented by Bose.

Buffett said there is a fair chance that inflation may ignite in a \"serious way.\"\nOn Friday, Buffett's insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway Inc reported an 18 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profit. This stemmed in part from weakness in businesses linked to housing, including units that make bricks and carpet, and that offer real estate brokerage services.\nBuffett said he is finding more buying opportunities in stocks following a 16 per cent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index from its recent high in October.\n\"I find more things to look at now than I did six months or a year ago,\" Buffett said. But he acknowledged that conditions have changed \"more dramatically\" in the bond market. Berkshire last year spent $19.11 billion on stocks and $13.39 billion on bonds.\nFalling security values and liquidity have pummeled bond insurers, which normally insure relatively safe municipal bonds but also guaranteed billions of dollars of riskier debt, often tied to subprime mortgages."}

Used as they were to travelling in air-conditioned vehicles with pick-ups and drops at their doorsteps, they were forced to look for alternative transport due to the cab operators’ strike from Wednesday midnight.\nFor a change, most of them had to jostle like other office-goers commuting in packed RTC buses and local trains, while some brought out their personal vehicles on the roads with an estimated 30,000 taxis and other vehicles, all with yellow registration plates, going off the road.\nContentious issue\nThe Greater Hyderabad Cab and Bus Operators Association went on strike demanding exemption from payment of Value Added Tax (VAT) with retrospective effect from 2003. Its contention was that the cabs and buses only provide a “service” and hence, VAT cannot be applied.\nPassengers to the Shamshabad airport did not have much of a problem as some radio cab operators did not participate in the strike and they made brisk business. “We don’t pay VAT as we operate vehicles with meters,” said Meru Cabs Senior Manager (operations) Joseph Gattu.\nThe usually clogged Madhapur junction saw a free vehicular flow since midnight. But, employees who logged out of their night shifts on Thursday morning had a torrid time reaching their destinations as they had to either hop onto buses or autos if a kind friend or relative did not come for a pick-up.\n‘Harrowing experience’\n“I went to my office in Madhapur by boarding an overcrowded RTC bus at Secunderabad.

In common parlance, however, it is rarely used in this literal sense which emphasises the type of death experienced, and is usually employed to refer to the act of deliberately inducing the death of a patient who is in severe pain and distress as a result of a terminal or incurable illness. There are two distinctions in euthanasia: active euthanasia and passive euthanasia.\nActive euthanasia can be defined as a deliberate act of ending the life of a patient with a terminal or incurable disease. Passive euthanasia is the deliberate withholding or withdrawing of life-prolonging medical treatment with the object of hastening the patient's death, as a result of which the patient dies earlier than he\/she would have diedhad treatment been continued. (Otlowski, Margaret, Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law, Oxford University Press.)\nMany arguments have been advanced by scholars, human rights philosophers and law thinkers advocating legalisation of euthanasia all over the world. These were made on the basis of moral, human rights, and utilitarian grounds. The moral ground is that it is against morality to leave someone in severe pain and do nothing for his\/her relief. The human rights angle is that leaving a patient in severe pain would amount to directly challenging the fundamental right of the individual i.e., the right to a dignified life. The utilitarian principle believes in the greatest degree of happiness to the maximum number of people. According to this, if anyone is terminally ill, lying in hospital and is in severe pain, then it would not bring his\/her family happiness and it will suffer because of his\/her pain. So, utilitarian thinkers argue that an act or abstaining from an act which does not give happiness to anyone is wrong.\nExercising the euthanasia option in any respect is wrong. First of all, it is in contradiction with the moral basis and beliefs of all religions. Every religion states that no one except God reserves the right to take a person's life. Secondly, it prompts doctors to go against their moral duty of always serving and safeguarding the patients irrespective of the severity of their health.\nAccording to the utilitarian principle, provided there is a balance of pain over pleasure, active euthanasia would be justified if it maximises the benefits for all, regardless of whether the patient can or cannot give consent. Thus, the interests of the individual are subordinated to the interests of the majority. Because of this possible manipulation of utilitarian arguments toward non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia, it ought to be rejected as a moral theory justifying only active voluntary euthanasia.\nThe basis of active voluntary euthanasia is to relieve patients of their pain by killing them with their consent. But the subjective assessment by the patient of his\/her own circumstances can be motivated by a fear of pain, suffering, dependency, undue influence or other causes. These factors combined together provide enough room for manipulation by external agents, which may benefit from the process of euthanasia. Thus, a patient might be unable to provide free and unbiased consent in his\/her interest. And considering the weak hold of India's administration and judicial system in rural areas, the chances of prohibiting the misuse of euthanasia are slim. Thus legalising active voluntary euthanasia poses a major risk.\nThe shortcomings of active voluntary euthanasia are further exposed in a hypothetical situation where the patient wants to die and gives his\/her consent for euthanasia but the doctor knows that by taking some positive steps the life can be prolonged. In such cases whose consent is to be considered?\nAnother major flaw appears in cases where the patients are either too old or are not in a state to give their consent. This poses a grave challenge to the idea as these cases abound everywhere. In such situations, involuntary euthanasia might be considered an option. But it can be realistically seen that it is more prone to misuse than active voluntary euthanasia. In cases where passive involuntary euthanasia is legal, Baylor said that a doctor would be free to accept or reject a patient's consent. If the physician accepts a patient's wish and undertakes treating him\/her, the law imposes a duty on the physician to continue treatment as long as the case requires. Then at least theoretically, if the doctor voluntarily omits to do an act, such as withholding medical treatment from a severely retarded or defective infant, knowing that such omission will cause death, he\/she will not be criminally liable under the euthanasia principles. I say theoretically because even though at least once a week a doctor somewhere in the Washington Metropolitan area decides that one of his\/her infant patients has no chance of a meaningful life and withholds treatment needed to keep the child alive; and even though one-third of the 24 infants died in the D.C. General Hospital in 1973 because doctors decided to withhold treatment, as of 1973, several researchers have concluded that there has never been a case dealing with this issue. (Article: Physician's Criminal Liability for the Practice of Euthanasia. The Foreman, perey 27, Baylor L Rev.54 1975). Thus it is apparent that the doctors cannot be questioned in such cases. This gives the doctors more than permissible control over the fate of the infants under their care.\nSo if you allow active euthanasia to be legalised then the flaws that will result are that in a majority cases, consent will not be free because consent could be motivated by a fear of pain, suffering or dependency. Also active euthanasia will not cover the width of arguments proposed by human rights activists and moral activists because most of the cases of patients with an incurable disease and those who are too old will not be in a position to give their consent. Consequently, this condition will increase the apprehensions over legalisation of passive euthanasia.\nPassive euthanasia will cover infants and unborn babies. We have the example of the Netherlands, where all these acts were legalised. As a result, Netherlands lost more than one-fourth of its population and it badly affected unborn babies with a high fall in birthrate in that country. This is evident from its population statistics. There is an important lesson to every country that is considering following this proponent country and legalising euthanasia. Euthanasia is impracticable in India given its susceptibility which makes it prone to misuse.\n( The writer is a student of the School of Law, Christ University, Bangalore.)\nRelated Topics"}

Moore later apologized, but stepped down 24 hours later.\nPlayers, both men and women, quickly denounced the comments and that continued Tuesday at the Miami Open. But there was also concern raised about comments Djokovic made suggesting the men should seek more money because their matches tend to attract more spectators.\n\"I think that our men's tennis world, ATP world, should fight for more, because the stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men's tennis matches,\" Djokovic said earlier this week. \"I think that's one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.\"\nWilliams disagreed when asked about the comments.\n\"If I have a daughter and she plays tennis, and I have a son who plays tennis, I wouldn't say that my son deserves more money because he's a man,\" she said. \"I would say they deserve the same amount of money.\n\"I think (Djokovic) is entitled to his opinion,\" she added. \"But if he has a daughter — I think he has a son right now — I think he should talk to his daughter and tell her his son deserves more money than you because he's a boy.\"\nAndy Murray, ranked No. 2 in the world, believes in equal pay.\n\"I think there should be equal pay, 100 percent, especially at all combined events,\" Murray said. \"The timing of it was just so strange. It was right before you had a great women's final with like 16,000 people sitting in the stadium.\nHe also noted that interest and attendance differs depending on the matches, saying a Williams match in Miami will pack a stadium more than many men's matches.\n\"Men's tennis has been lucky over the last 10 years because of the quality of players,\" he said. \"But the whole of tennis should capitalize on that and not just the men's game, in my opinion.\"\nWTA chief executive officer Steve Simon, who came to the WTA last fall after being the tournament director of the BNP Paribas Open, released a statement related to Moore's departure on Tuesday.\n\"Raymond Moore has taken full responsibility for the unacceptable comments he has made,\" Simon said. \"It is the right decision for him to step down. The BNP Paribas Open has supported the payment of equal prize money to all players since 2009. The WTA looks forward to working with Mr. (Larry) Ellison and the Indian Wells team on continued efforts in making the sport better and equal for all players.\"\nAmerican John Isner also expressed his disappointment over the Moore incident.\n\"I think those comments were in a bit of poor taste,\" Isner said. \"It has caused somewhat of a controversy now. As far as our tour is concerned, the ATP is fighting for what we think we're worth and the WTA is doing that as well.\""}

It said test flights of aircraft are carried out at the HAL Airport along with commercial airlines operations. It said mixed traffic of military and commercial flights is not conducive to flight safety.\nHAL also has several other wings in its vicinity such as aerospace, aircraft, engine, foundry and forge, helicopter, industrial and marine gas and overhaul divisions. Moreover, the fuel complex of Indian Oil is situated adjacent to the car park and this is a hazard, it said. It said HAL Airport could not be retained for commercial flights and any change in the concessional agreement could lead to legal proceedings.\nSpeaking on behalf of the Bench, the Chief Justice sought to orally know about reports that a Parliamentary Standing Committee had recommended that the existing airports at Bangalore and Hyderabad be retained.\nWhen BIAL said the petitioners had not challenged the concessional agreement of 2004 and that the petitions could be dismissed solely on the grounds of delay, the Chief Justice remarked that the petitioners were complaining about the connectivity to the airport and the lack of infrastructure. Their grouse was that until all facilities are provided, HAL Airport could continue. \\\nBIAL said Rs. 1,000 crore had already been spent on widening the road and two of the loops of the trumpet junction coming up near BIAL airport was already completed. Other petitioners said the Centre could not decide on the closure of HAL airport without consulting Airports Authority of India.

There are five permanent members, and so this will be a requirement for us to continue to consult within the UN and within the Security Council on an appropriate way forward.\"\nObama \"did highlight the fact that, as we continue to promote reform within the UN Security Council, it is inconceivable that you could contemplate UN Security Council reform without considering a country like India\", Crowley said.\nAsked what steps the US was taking to ensure that Pakistan brings perpetrators of 26\/11 to justice as stated by Obama, Crowley said: \"We cooperate with Pakistan and India on counterterrorism cooperation. But ultimately, the solution here, first and foremost, rests within Pakistan.\"\nFrom the State Department's perspective \"the visit has achieved everything that we'd hoped for\", he said.\n\"As the president reinforced today (Monday), his was the third consecutive administration of Democrats and Republicans to visit India.\n\"It demonstrates the importance of our relationship and the importance of India's emerging role in the world. And as President Obama made clear, he will not be the last president to visit India.\""}

A recent study carried out by the Centre for Women’s Development and Research indicates that 73 per cent of single women living in residential colonies of South Chennai faced high levels of violence, both sexual and physical, from men in their neighbourhood. A vast majority of these cases went unreported as the women chose not to approach the police fearing societal backlash.\nThese shocking statistics emerged from the study that was conducted between July and November this year in the residential areas of Santhome, Adyar, Besant Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, Velachery and Mylapore.\nAmong the women surveyed, 43 per cent were widows, 26 per cent deserted by their husbands, 15 per cent divorced, 12 per cent deserted their husbands and six per cent unmarried. They were in the age group of 28 to 40.\nGiving details of the study, K R Renuka, executive director, Centre for Women’s Development and Research, said economic empowerment of women had led to an increase in the number of single women as divorce had become a common feature. The study showed that among the women divorced, more than 90% remained unmarried whereas divorced men usually opted for remarriage immediately.\nThe nature of violence these women face include sexual advances by neighbours and break-ins by the local thugs. “Most of their cases are taken up by the NGOs because when they report it to the police authorities, the blame falls on them. Moreover, if they report it formally, they get singled out and noticed in the locality, thereby becoming vulnerable targets,” said another member of the Centre.\nSaveetha Murali (name changed), a 40-year-old single woman who lives in Adyar, shared her harrowing experience with Express, “Though things have come a long way from what they were before, single women are still an easy target. I want to live alone, and I like it, but that does not in anyway mean I am available. It is not just advances by men in the neighbourhood, but also by those in the workplace that we encounter frequently.” Sadly, the men who make these lewd advances get away while the women are left to face the societal wrath simply because they are living alone, she added.\nRenuka said safety concerns are not the only issue; only 10 per cent of the women have been able to claim their maintenance rights and less than four per cent are able to get back their dowry amount after the divorce.\nRenuka pointed out that it was high time the government came up with a policy for the protection of single women. “Widow pension still remains Rs 400 per month and the government needs to come up with an allocation specifically for the single women. As per statistics available with the Government of India, there are 32 million single women in India. There is a rise in the number of single women, but there has been no specific headcount on that aspect in Tamil Nadu.”\n“Women from the unorganised sector are open about the violences, but not those who are from middle class families. They continue to suffer in silence, suffocated as they are by the so called family values and the fear of being blamed for living alone,” she added."}

The move is aimed at ensuring transparency and smooth conduct of the examinations.\nGerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, said, “Under this initiative, answer books will carry photographs of the student as well as their UID number which they tend to fill up wrongly due to exam stress.”\nTill 2015, each examinee had to write her\/his name, unique identification number (UID), and the name of the subject on the answer sheet booklets.\nFrom 2016, the answer sheet will have students’ photograph, name, UID, and name of the subject printed on it. The number of pages of the answer booklets will remain the same – 16 for ICSE and 20 for ISC. The portion of the top-sheet of a booklet that will bear the name and photograph will be torn off and retained by the council before the scripts are distributed for evaluation.\nThis will be done to ensure confidentiality. Once the scripts are marked, the results will be prepared by matching the UIDs with the corresponding names in the council's database. The new system is aimed at preventing mistakes committed by students while writing their names and UIDs.\nThe council will send the answer booklets of the students in separate packets. Each packet will have the photograph and other identity details of the student printed on it. Each sealed packet will contain the answer booklets of all subjects in which the particular student will take the examination. That means if a school has 150 ICSE examinees, it will receive as many packets containing answer booklets.\nTill 2015, the council used to send the answer sheets in bundles of up to 500 booklets each. The booklets were distributed according to their serial numbers. Separate sets of answer sheets for every examinee were introduced by the council to streamline the system.\nRelated Topics"}

His indignant lawyers immediately said they would appeal.\nDespite years of legal battles, the proceedings at the packed court in Milan amounted to one of the more humiliating episodes Berlusconi has faced.\nJudge Edoardo d'Avossa pronounced that between 2000 and 2003, there had been \"a very significant amount of tax evasion\" and \"an incredible mechanism of fraud\" in place around the buying and selling of broadcasting rights for Berlusconi's Mediaset television company. The court's written ruling said he showed a \"natural capacity for crime\".\nBerlusconi, one of Italy's richest men, became prime minister for a second time in 2001 after winning a landslide victory.\nBut he remained in effective charge of Mediaset even though he had handed over control of day-to-day operations, the court said.\nIn a theatrical response granted to his own television channel, Berlusconi condemned the sentence as \"intolerable judicial harassment\".\n\"If you can't count on impartial judges in a country, the country becomes uncivil, barbarian and unlivable and stops being a democracy. It's sad, but the situation of our country today is that way,\" he told Mediaset.\nDenouncing the verdict as \"incredible\", his defence lawyers Piero Longo and Niccolo Ghedini said: \"It is to be hoped that in the appeals court there will be a different atmosphere.\" He is entitled to two levels of appeal.\nThe court found that Berlusconi and 10 co-defendants were behind a scheme by Mediaset to purchase the rights to broadcast American films on his private television networks through a series of offshore companies, and had falsely declared the payments to avoid taxes.\nProsecutors said that they inflated the price for the TV rights of some 3,000 films as they re-licensed them internally to Berlusconi's networks, pocketing the difference that amounted to 250 million euros.\nThe trial began in July 2006, but was put on hold by a now-defunct immunity law that shielded him from prosecution while he was premier.\nThe initial sentence was heavier than the three years and eight months requested by prosecutors, and was the longest of the four Berlusconi has received so far in a career dogged by marathon legal battles.\nThe verdict came two days after Berlusconi announced he will not run in forthcoming elections, which are expected to be held in April.\nHe stepped down last November after Italy came under mounting pressure to deal with its high debts and he failed to come up with persuasive financial reforms.\nBerlusconi's legal woes began even before he was elected to the first of his three terms as premier in 1994.\nHe has been tried numerous times for his business dealings as head of Mediaset and AC Milan football club. His lawyer last year claimed he had been called to appear at more than 2,500 hearings involving around 100 cases since he was first elected.\nHe has always denied wrongdoing and alleged that the cases were politically motivated. In each case to date, he has been cleared or seen the statute of limitations expire. The statute of limitations in the Mediaset case is set to terminate sometime next year.\nThe former premier is also on trial in Milan on charges of paying for sex with an alleged under-age prostitute nicknamed Ruby the Heart Stealer and trying to cover it up through an abuse of office. He again denies the allegations.\nIn the latest hearing yesterday in the sex trial, which began more than a year ago, Berlusconi's personal doctor said he had advised the then prime minister to avoid too much \"excitement\" at the gatherings, to which dozens of aspiring actresses and showgirls were invited.\nBut Alberto Zangrillo insisted he had never witnessed \"moments of a sexual nature\" nor \"girls in skimpy clothing\" at the so-called \"bunga bunga\" parties."}

How can Feng Shui assist you in being determined and focused to ensure that your weighing scales show the weight reduction you dream of?\nIf you are following all the rules, doing rigorous work outs and weight loss programs, and yet your weighing scales do not show any changes, then Feng Shui advises you to look for clues around your dining areas which will motivate you.\nOne way to influence your quantum of in take of food is by hanging a mirror in the dining area and as many women would agree, looking at your self in a mirror can motivate you to adhere to the weight loss program. Research in US University show that those who consumed food in front of the mirror ate up to almost 32 per cent less fat. This reduces the cravings inside you. Eating slowly is another way to curtail intake of more food. As studies have shown that when you eat slowly you tend to eat less. Placing a “ticking clock” near the place where you eat is the trick. The repetitive sound which is a measured frequency of the clock ticking creates a relaxed and slow chewing pace. It is simple, by eating slowly and with the rhythmic sound of the clock ticking, you give the brain a chance to catch up with your stomach and register “I feel full” sensation before you go for the next serving and you will “feel full faster”.\nFeng Shui always recommends a warm red and earthly colour for the dining areas to enhance the appetite. However, if you are desperate to “turn off your hunger,” you can make the changes in the dining table décor by adding a black table runner or try out black china ware food plates. The color black absorbs energy hence it subdues your hunger.\nLook around the kitchen and check for clutter and untidy areas. Prior to your meal, clear up the kitchen clutter and wipe down the kitchen counters. Clutter is “work pending “to be cleared and this represents yet another “to-do” and drains your energy and determination to eat properly. It has been observed that untidiness is always linked to clumsiness and even over eating. The smallest effort to clean up your kitchen and clearing the trash can make you stay focused and stick to your diet by fuelling the feeling of “I can do it”. A simple approach in Feng Shui to enhance your determination by de-cluttering.\nFeng Shui can assist you to make you progress towards appearing fit and shed the extra flab by creating the right environment which in turn makes you determined and focused. Feng Shui by itself cannot activate or replace your existing diet or weight loss program but can be additional tool to enhance your efforts."}

He denied all charges and blamed the corruption on others in his inner circle, thus forgoing the opportunity to earn leniency as is customarily given in Chinese courts when a defendant expresses contrition.\nBo also became the highest-level politician convicted for corruption under China's leader Xi Jinping, who has staked his reputation on combatting graft within the Communist Party.\n\"I think the point is that Xi wanted to punish Bo for daring to go against the party's arrangements,\" said Willy Lam, an expert on party politics at Chinese University in Hong Kong. \"He was punished for his disobedience and defiance.\"\nAccording to details of Sunday's proceedings released by the court in Twitter-like posts, Bo was escorted into the courtroom by marshals and stood to listen as the judge read out the lengthy verdict. He had crew-cut hair and wore a white shirt and black pants.\nThe court sentenced Bo to life in prison on the bribery charges, 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power.\nThe court rejected Bo's defense that he did not know about the $3.5 million in bribes from two business associates in the form of extensive valuable gifts to his family — including a French villa, expenses-paid trips, an electric scooter and fancy delicacies such as abalone. However, the court said a small portion of the bribes alleged by prosecutors, of about $160,000 were not proven in court.\nThe trial proceedings had been publicized through partial transcripts that gave a measure of legitimacy to a trial seen by many observers to have a foregone conclusion of guilt and predetermined sentence because of the Communist Party leadership's control over the court system.\n\"This is a big victory for Xi Jinping's leadership, because you cannot say this is a secretive trial. It is at least a semi-open trial,\" said Li Cheng, an expert of elite politics at Brookings Institute. \"Bo's political career is zero, and the trial really transformed Bo from a charismatic leader to a self-indulging person.\"\nBo's downfall was set in motion in February 2012 when his former top aide attempted to defect to a U.S. consulate with information about his wife's murder of British businessman Neil Heywood. Prosecutors later accused Bo of interfering with the investigation into the murder, as well as unrelated corruption uncovered by investigators.\nBo's wife, Gu Kailai, confessed to the murder and was handed a suspended death sentence last year that will likely be commuted to life imprisonment."}

With a production capacity of 1.7 million litres per year, the methanol, an alternative fuel, will be made from carbon dioxide extracted from steam emitted by the power plant, making it the first of its kind in the world. Once the next two stages are completed in 2011 and 2012, it can touch a peak capacity of 5.1 million litres per year.\nMethanol can be used for internal combustion engines in vehicles in the same way as gasoline and diesel oil.

L-18, Batla House in Jamia Nagar locality here on September 19, 2008, six days after serial bomb blasts rocked Delhi, killing 26 persons and injuring 133 others. The police had reached Batla House on a tip off that some suspected militants involved in the blasts were holed up in the building.\nOf the five flat occupants, Atif Ameen and Mohd Sajid were killed during the encounter.\nHighly-decorated Delhi Police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma succumbed to the bullet injuries sustained during the gun battle while head constable Balwant was injured.\nApart from these two, one Ariz Khan alias Junaid had been declared a proclaimed offender while Mohd Saif was not made an accused in this case as according to the prosecution, he had surrendered peacefully and did not play any part in the entire incident.\nThe police team had recovered two .30 bore pistols and one A K series rifle with two loaded magazines, containing 30 live cartridges from the spot.

The Industrial Cooperative Group Housing Society, Sector 51, was directed to pay Rs 3.5 lakh after a complainant was not allotted his flat despite possessing a will that was executed in his favour.\nThe complainant Rajinder Singh, a resident of Sector 22, stated that Sudhir Kumar Jain, a shareholder in the Industrial Cooperative House Building Society, executed a will and a sale agreement in 2002 in his (the complainant's) favour. The attesting witness to all the documents was Tejinder Singh, president of the society. Therefore, the complainant paid all the instalments to the society on behalf of Jain.\nAfter Jain died in 2004, the complainant requested the society to give full effect to the registered will by transferring the deceased's share in his favour. However, the society did not accede to his request.\nRajinder also gave a cheque of Rs 1,66,410 on account of the cost of land, but the society refused to accept it on the ground that the complainant was no longer entitled to the share, as the flat stood transferred in the name of the nominee  Sudha Jain, wife of Sudhir Kumar Jain.\nTherefore, the complainant sought a clarification from the Registrar, UT Cooperative Societies, with regard to transfer of the shares. Consequently, a public notice was issued to the society and the flat transferred in the complainant's name after a delay of three years.\nIn its reply, the society pleaded that all the payments were made in the name of the original member (Sudhir Jain) and any the depositor is not entitled for allotment of flats. Further, the flats were declared 'not transferable' before the expiry of five years from the date of allotment as per Clause 6 of the Chandigarh Allotment of Land to Cooperative House Building Societies Scheme, 1991."}

I'm getting in the way of that. A fresh CEO earns you that chance.\"\nShares jumped more than 4 percent in extended trading following Thursday's announcement, which had been anticipated for months. Executive Chairman Eric Lefkofsky and Vice Chairman Ted Leonsis were appointed to the Office of the Chief Executive while a replacement is found.\nMason made no qualms about what had happened.\n\"I've decided that I'd like to spend more time with my family. Just kidding — I was fired today,\" Mason, 32, wrote. \"If you're wondering why. you haven't been paying attention.\"\nHe referred to controversy over the accounting practices used in regulatory filings ahead of Groupon Inc.'s November 2011 initial public offering of stock as well as \"two quarters of missing our own expectations and a stock price that's hovering around one quarter of our listing price.\"\n\"The events of the last year and a half speak for themselves,\" he wrote. \"As CEO, I am accountable.\"\nThe announcement came one day after Groupon reported a bigger-than-expected loss and gave a weak revenue outlook for the current quarter. The guidance had fueled investor worry — which started even before Groupon's IPO — that people are suffering from fatigue over the frequent emails flooding subscribers' inboxes. There were also worries that the company's efforts to broaden into an e-commerce powerhouse haven't been paying off.\nGroupon said Mason was not available for interviews.\nHis ouster has been \"fairly widely expected\" given the company's performance, said Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg. Mason was CEO, after all, \"and as the expression goes 'the buck stops there,'\" he added.\n\"The question is whether this as a business model can last,\" Gartenberg said. \"It's easy to replicate and under a lot of pressure. The question is where the company goes from here.... Clearly something wasn't working, isn't working.\"\nIn a statement, Leonsis said, \"Groupon will continue to invest in growth, and we are confident that with our deep management team and market-leading position, the company is well positioned for the future.\"\nGroupon Inc. makes money by taking a cut from the online deals it offers on a variety of goods and services. Investors have questioned whether that business model is sustainable and leads to growth over the long term — and whether the company can not only grow its customer base but make more from each subscriber.\nGroupon had the advantage of being first, but the model is easy to replicate. It has spawned many copycats after its 2008 launch, from startups such as LivingSocial to established companies such as Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Chicago-based Groupon Inc. also has faced scrutiny about its high marketing expenses, enormous employee base and the way it accounted for revenue.\n\"There was always a sense that Groupon had a lot of good ideas but no real focus,\" said Benchmark Capital analyst Daniel Kurnos, adding that with Mason's ouster the board made the decision to try to \"get the ship moving in the right direction.\"\nCan a new CEO answer all their problems? Kurnos doesn't think so. But maybe he can get Groupon more focused and steer it toward more traditional businesses. Groupon Goods, for example, which sells products rather than restaurant or spa deals, has been performing well. With its deals, Groupon's challenge is to balance pleasing merchants who sell the deals with pleasing the customers who buy them, he added.\n\"A lot of people want to say that the daily deals business is a zero,\" he said. \"I don't think that's true.\"\nMason, a Northwestern University graduate and former punk band keyboardist, founded Groupon in 2008. By 2010, Groupon was available in 25 countries and its staff ballooned to nearly 10,000, many times that of other Internet darlings such as Twitter, Facebook or Zynga Inc., the other fallen star of the latest swath of Internet IPOs.\nGartenberg, like other analysts, wasn't surprised by Mason's ouster, but by the fact that \"it took them this long.\" He called the way it came out \"refreshingly honest.\"\n\"There was no pretense that he is leaving to pursue other interests or spending more time with his family,\" he said.\nGroupon's stock has lost about 77 percent of its value since the IPO after losing $1.45, or 24 percent, to close Thursday at $4.53. After the announcement of Mason's ouster, the stock gained 19 cents to $4.72 in after-hours trading. The modest 4.2 percent gain, compared with the 24 percent drop earlier in the day, is a sign that investors will need more than the CEO's firing to start believing in Groupon again."}

Nor do they go for hills, lakes or rivers – there aren't any. But for people who love water, there is no place on earth quite like it. You wake to the hypnotic sound of oceanic waves. When you step into the water, it is like being in your own private aquarium. Imagine a designer like Kenzo or Missoni being let loose on fish: those ravishing catwalk colours and patterns are exactly what you see when you look under the waters of the Indian Ocean.\nThe curious mixture of honeymooners and scuba divers drawn to this island nation stay in luxurious water villas built over lagoons and connected to the land by narrow jetties. So compelling is the ocean that it is very difficult to get anything done. Isolated in your own little slice of hotel heaven, you can either retreat into blissful, self-imposed purdah, gazing for hours at the ocean, or spy, Rear Window-style, on other guests. Normally this kind of undercover people-watching is one of the quiet joys of hotel life, but here it is the fish that are the greatest distraction. Who wants to look at love-struck couples downing margaritas in the hotel bar when you could be swimming with the fishes in a warm, deserted lagoon with no jet skis or speedboats to spoil things? Of the 87 resort islands, I picked Baros as my first stop because it has a tiny diving school that offers one-to-one tuition for novices. Off-season (July), there were so few guests that I felt as though I had the place to myself. There was no danger of bumping into anyone I knew. And I was comforted by the size of the island: it is so small that in only half an hour you can swim around it – and that's without flippers.\nOn my second day, I looked out at a sea so calm and benevolent it would have been a crime not to go underwater. Of course I could have gone snorkelling, but I had always wanted to learn to dive in a beautiful, sunlit place, free from other people and the municipal misery of a public pool in Britain. Until now I had always been too scared to try, even when foreign holidays offered the opportunity. It wasn't fear of sharks but of all the technical things that could go wrong. What if my goggles leaked, or my tank ran out of oxygen?\nAfter breakfast, I grabbed my swimsuit and went in search of the island's diving instructors, Derk and Margreet Molenaar, a free-spirited Dutch couple who operate from a timber-roofed hut at the end of a jetty. Could they teach me one to one? It was early in the morning and none of the other guests had surfaced. Margreet took me under her wing.\nAfter she ran me through the rudiments and taught me a few signals – an \"o\" with my fingers to indicate I'm OK, a fluttering of one hand to show there's a problem – she helped me into a light wetsuit, cut off at the knee and elbow. \"Baros is a very good island for beginners because of the house reef and lagoon,\" she said, as we walked along a beach shaped like a crescent moon.\nAt the water's edge, a small tank was hoisted onto my back and an astonishingly hefty belt tied at my waist. \"Any sharks?\" I asked, nerves in shreds, as I lowered myself into the water, wondering if I would drown under all that weight. \"Yes, there are white- and blacktip reef sharks in the lagoon, but they don't go after humans unless you provoke or tease them,\" she said, tightening my belt. \"There must be a reason.\"\nSo that's OK, then, I told myself. So long as I behave, they will. Not quite the reassurance I had hoped for, but I was quickly distracted by what was going on below me. One moment I was snorkelling merrily, hearing the splash of my flippers and the encouraging cries of my friends on the beach; the next I was plunged into a mesmerising underwater world, clutching Margreet's hand as I swam through shafts of sunlight, the only noise the rasp of my breathing.\nAs we circled and swooped, she pointed out shoals of stripy Oriental sweetlips, spotted eagle rays and red-tailed butterfly fish. All these deceptively Disney-like creatures were going about their business with supreme indifference to us, and it was strangely reassuring. Slowly we swam deeper until we could see parrot fish nibbling on the coral and sea cucumbers coiled like snakes on the waterbed. When we eventually came up, it was in slow stages. We had been underwater for almost an hour, but it felt like only 10 minutes.\nBack at the diving centre, as I peeled off my wetsuit, Margreet told me about Kuda Haa, a reef known locally as \"fish soup\", which is heaving with turtles, reef sharks, Napoleon fish and moray eels. All I needed to go there was to pass my PADI certificate – just four more days of training. As I headed back to my water villa, barefoot, wet-haired and giddy with joy, I suddenly understood why diving was so addictive.

P Susheendhra Rao, district educational officer, Hyderabad told Express they recently conducted a review of teaching staff in government schools and found the problem of less teaching staff prevailed in all primary and high schools. “As many as 802 government schools are functioning in the city and most are running without proper teaching faculty.\nWe have made a list of 50 schools which require urgent postings of teachers,” he said.\nHe said they are having a tough time in appointing teachers and is increasing every year. “We have already chalked out a plan to recruit more than 800 Vidya volunteers and post them in schools where teacher strength is low. As the problem exists in both primary and high schools, we are planning to appoint teachers in a phased manner,’’ he added.\nIn all, there are 3,037 schools in the twin cities.\n“Buildings and other infrastructure would be provided to all schools under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund, NABARD and Sarva Siksha Abhiyan,” Rao said.\nHe said the government has identified dilapidated school buildings and decided to build about 800 rooms for primary and high schools this year."}

The UNC sees the move as an attempt to truncate the concept of a greater Nagalim.\nThe Centre has been accused of turning a blind eye to the activities of the UNC, with which the Union government had signed a framework agreement in 2015 to resolve the decades-old Naga issue.\n“We will soon send a notice for holding talks with UNC and the Manipur government. Let’s see, if they respond to the notice. Last time, on 15th November, 2016, when such meeting was held, no representative of the Manipur government showed up,” said a senior government official. The official added that the meeting has been proposed to be held in Delhi on February 5, 2017.\nLast week, the Centre pressed into service two C-17 Globemaster cargo aircrafts to airlift six fuel tankers to Imphal. An official said that 96 kilolitres of petrol was airlifted to ease the oil shortage in the State.\nEnding the deadlock\nThe Union government even sought Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi’s opinion to end the economic blockade. After consultation, it concluded that no law permitted Centre to interfere in the matter, as law and order was a State subject.\n“We have been sending Central forces and are doing our bit. The State government has not been forthcoming to end the deadlock as the current situation would help them in the upcoming elections,” said the official.\nManipur is going to the polls on March 4 and 8 and due to the ongoing economic blockade, it has been kept in the most sensitive category, an official said, adding that elections were being held in two phases for the first time in the State..\nAround 17,500 Central forces are deployed in Manipur currently and another 50,000 would reach there in March after elections in the other four States are over. The Centre has even kept choppers and aircraft on standby, in case forces need to be airlifted.\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh had earlier sent a tough message to Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh that if the State government failed in discharging its constitutional duties, the Centre “may have to explore other measures under the provisions of Constitution of India to ensure that the difficulties of the people of Manipur are alleviated.”\nHome Ministry’s worry\nThe Home Ministry had earlier written a letter to the Election Commission of India (ECI) regarding the “ongoing tension and grave law and order situation” and requested it to defer the elections in the State in wake of shortage of security forces.\nThe EC overruled Home Ministry’s apprehensions and announced that polls will be held in the State in two phases on March 4 and 8.\nRelated Topics"}

His leap into the spotlight has brought him face to face with a monumental challenge… but the question is can he retire super-rich? Arora is the first out of India, if you disregard Rohit Bal’s tentative forays, to use his name to great profit. He has done watches, sunglasses, vodka bottles, cosmetics, shoes, coffee salons, all for mega global brands.\nAs Arora takes over the creative reins of Paco Rabanne, now owned by the Spain-based Puig Investments, his creative mettle will be tested once again.\nThe company has not shown a ready-to-wear offering since 2006—when Rabanne withdrew from fashion to “pursue other creative endeavours”. Even if one was to assume that global fashion is becoming more inclusive, where the heck does an Indian fit in?\nBoth Rabanne and Arora are known for their elaborate and avant-garde approach. The Franco-Spanish Rabanne started off designing jewelry for Dior and Givenchy and then sparked a storm with his first collection called 12 Unwearable Dresses in Contemporary Materials, using metal, paper and plastic. Though Arora draws from his Indian heritage with all its decorative chutzpah, he is anything but conventional. His delightful jigsaw dress with Swarovski crystals is a case in point… almost evoking Rabanne’s classic metal armour dress.\nWhen the Arora’s appointment was made, Rabanne said: “The time has come for new experiences. The Paco Rabanne House must invent other things, touch different universes, have a different outlook and reach out to the public differently. From now on we must avoid the industrial dimension but return to the craftsmanship aspect and produce small collections.”\nAs an Arora follower, I know he is up for the job, but is Puig? With its business stacked in perfume distribution licences and retail brands like Mango and Zara, it is making a strong pitch for a more complete luxury fashion portfolio.\nThe truth is that Paco Rabanne is no more the plum that it was. And though Arora is the va-va-voom guy of the moment, whom everybody in the scratchy fashion business knows and likes, at the end of the day it will not be just about his talent, but the marketing acumen of Puig’s management.\nThe life expectancy of a new company or a fashion label like Paco Rabanne trying to re-invent itself is, relatively speaking, along the lines of a particularly fragile butterfly.\nTake the case of Vanessa G & Ashish Soni. As CEO and co-founder of South Africa’s HolGoun Investment Holdings, Billionaire Vanessa Gounden’s primary investments are in coal, uranium, healthcare, risk management solutions, and property. She is diversifying and making a play for a piece of the global luxury business, estimated by Goldman Sachs to touch a trillion dollars by 2025.\nLater this month, she will launch her luxury fashion label, Vanessa G, with Ashish Soni helming it’s creative direction.\nIt’s not a curious coincidence that both an old foreign label and a new one have chosen Indian designers. It merely indicates the fact that the tipping point has arrived for Indian design. Sure, there was Ritu Beri in Paris with Scherrer, mentored by Mounis Mouffarige who famously made Stella McCartney a household name. Yet, when Moufarrige picked the Indian, it was clear that she was a disaster. Even till date, what her vision for the house was is anybody’s guess. More recently, Moufarrige brought Lindsey Lohan to Ungaro with an equally tacky outcome.\nI expect both Arora and Soni to draw much better lines in global markets this year. Fortune does favour the brave. They have persevered single-mindedly to access environments that play a critical role in world fashion, the catwalks of New York, London and Paris. Year after year, both Soni and Arora have made huge personal investments just to be seen by the bi-coastal club. Though Soni has not triggered off the buzz of Arora, he has caught sweet press for his authoritative calm in interpreting glocal fashion.\nBoth of them should become symbols of a new generation of tastemakers to carry the torch for Indian design beyond the country’s fantastical exoticism.\n(The writer chronicles the luxury space in India)"}

Many doctors do not have the skills to perform such medical examinations and the absence of guidelines for treatment of sexual abuse victims can lead to further trauma.\n\"It is hard enough for sexually abused child or their relatives to come forward and seek help, but instead of handling cases with sensitivity Indian authorities often demean and re-traumatise them,\" Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said.\nThe report recommends that the government implement a protocol for all public health facilities developed according to the WHO guidelines and that doctors and medical staff should be trained to respond to cases of sexual abuse in a sensitive manner, including minimally invasive examinations.\nA standard part of the examination for female rape victims in India is the \"two-finger test\" to check the size and state of hymen and vagina for signs of sexual intercourse and violence. But forensic experts say the test has no scientific value and the Ministry of Women and Child Development recently recommended it be abolished as it heightens the trauma of victims.\nIn one case detailed in the report, a 15-year-old girl, forced to work as a maid, claimed she was raped by her boss. She was given a \"two-finger\" test after she escaped from her abuser and, on the basis of this test, the doctor stated that the girl had not been raped. Police have now refused to probe her complaint.\nIn rape cases, corroboration by forensic evidence is not mandatory where prosecution can secure a conviction based on the victim's testimony, but medico-legal reports can often play an important role in whether or not the police and judiciary believe the claims.Kira Spucys-Tahar"}

Those are excerpts from recorded conversations between Tulshidas Desai, marketing manager of OHeraldO (the Herald) and Goa-based journalist Mayabhushan Nagvenkar.\nThe journalist was pulling off a sting posing as Bernard Costa, a would-be candidate in the State's Assembly polls to be held early next year.\nSales pitch\nThe Herald's marketing manager is making a sales pitch when the journalist calls up and asks how much it would cost to have an interview of himself dressed up as news. The Herald claims to be Goa's largest-circulated English daily.\n“Ya, but can you send me a quotation?” the journalist posing as a candidate asks Mr. Desai. “A rough quotation [of what it costs]?” Mr. Desai knows an ethical line is being crossed and is wary of leaving a trail. “This is like an editorial kind of thing, no,” he says. “I can't mention on the paper, you know … .”\nMoney for interview\nIn the conversations, the marketing manager appears to confirm that Raymond D'Sa [an aspiring candidate from Cortalim in south Goa] paid Rs. 2 lakh to get his ‘interview' carried in the Herald of October 20, the morning of the conversation.\nMr. Nagvenkar: “So Raymond's interview was [for] two lakh [rupees].” Desai: “Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya …” But “you are not going to say advertorial, [above the interview], no? asks the journalist. No, Mr. Desai [who first mentioned ‘advertorial'] reassures him. It would be just like Raymond D'Sa's interview. “Today how nothing is mentioned no? Like that only … .” However, Mr. D'Sa, when contacted by The Hindu , flatly denied having made any payment for the interview.\nSince these audio recordings went public, all hell has broken loose. Except in Goa's media, which remains stoically silent on a scandal which broke just after the Election Commission of India handed out the first-ever verdict in Indian electoral history disqualifying a sitting legislator for improper accounts and indulging in “paid news.”\nRelated Topics"}

''unfortunately, agencies don't take such things seriously. we need awareness in the society,'' she said. right. but if rai herself needed to make a complaint on a helpline for women in trouble, being run by her own organisation, she wouldn't be able to do it. she didn't remember the number, claiming it was changed recently. but can't dcw do anything else for women? sure it can. in december 2000, it grandly announced crash courses in karate for women. the intention was great, for delhi has an abundance of men who don't vacate seats reserved for women in buses and then attempt physical contact with them. or brush past them on streets, forcibly enter ladies compartments in trains, honk, ogle, chase and tease lone women drivers. just that in nine months since the announcement, the scheme hasn't taken-off. ''the process is on. it's just that we have not been to locate the right ngo which can implement this scheme for us,'' rai said. that delhi is a rogue city is a settled fact by now. so why is that only four women each day bother to call 3317004, the police control room helpline number for women, though men make over 100 calls on the pcr number, if only to attempt vulgar conversation with women operators. why is it that the dcw helpline also gets just over 20 such calls a day? joint police commissioner (operations) shiv chaudhary believes this could be because police already have crime against women cell offices in districts. rai says women call them mostly to share problem, not register some serious complaints. whatever the official explanation, women have simply learnt ways to survive delhi's treacherous terrain."}

Clearly in a democracy, lot depends on feedback that you get, opinions, change in perceptions and reassessment from time to time. No party nor individual should become a slave of a decision that has been taken or become confined to a limited view. I don't know what kind of intellectual exercise he (Rahul) went through.

The pursuance power of the idea that he gave, was apparent to everybody. Now, you can say why it was not apparent earlier. It may well have been apparent to many people. The reason why we did the ordinance in the first place was largely to do with pragmatic politics, and politics is a matter of practicality and pragmatism. At times, a larger reason of higher public morality can override practical, pragmatic politics. And this kind of interplay between pragmatism and principle takes place in politics all the time."}

In it, Raja had again requested the JPC chairman to let him depose before the panel so as to allow the “truth” to come out.\nTiruchy Siva too had asked Chacko to “convene” a meeting of the Committee to discuss the future course of action in view of Raja’s request to bring out the truth. Siva had written that the JPC chairman was not only going against parliamentary convention but also denying “opportunity to a parliamentary Committee to hear a key witness”.\nChacko has not given in to the pressure to call Raja by citing two reasons: One that his case is subjudice and he will not be able to go beyond what he has already told the courts as an accused in the case; secondly, as the JPC is looking at spectrum pricing and allocation policies of consecutive governments from the NDA period onwards, one former telecom minister (Raja) can’t be called in isolation.\nHowever, Sinha has brushed aside these arguments asserting that not calling Raja defeats the purpose for which the JPC was set up in the first place-that is, getting to the bottom of the 2G scam.\nReferring to the three letters that Raja wrote (one to the LS Speaker and two to Chacko), Sinha said, “I think it’s a very serious omission that the Chairman of JPC is making by not inviting Raja to depose before the panel. Raja is right in casting aspersion on the intention of the JPC.”\nSinha said that it was not just his view alone, but the opposition MPs from the Left are also on the same page on this.\n“I think we are proceeding in a direction where the JPC will be used to conceal the truth rather than expose the truth. And, it is very serious matter. Unfortunately, the Chairman of JPC, despite our request, is not calling a meeting of the panel so that the matter could be thrashed out.”\nBut Chacko maintains that he had undertaken the writing of the report with the concurrence of the members of the panel and no meeting is possible before the first draft is ready."}

{"id":2955,"label":1,"url":"http:\/\/archive.indianexpress.com\/news\/the-almost-revolutionaries\/353218\/","text":"The almost revolutionaries - Indian Express\nA. P. S. Malhotra\nAlmost two decades ago, I stood with some friends at Delhi University, discussing plans for the day: which classes to bunk and which, if any, to attend. Suddenly, a motley group of slogan-shouting students emerged from the dhaba. They exhorted us to join the protest against the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, which had been implemented a day earlier. Although none of us was clear about the issue or its repercussions, the prospect of bunking classes was reason enough. Thus we too joined the sloganeering. By the time the self-styled leaders had commandeered a few DTC buses, nearly 200 postgraduate and doctoral students had gathered at an intersection, which later became the epicentre of protests and was rechristened euphemistically as Kranti Chowk.\nStudents from various medical colleges of Delhi were already there, even as buses from the North Campus reached India Gate. The leaders goaded the \"revolutionaries\" to move towards Parliament, where the monsoon session was in progress. But we encountered police barricades much before that. Some hotheads tried to gatecrash, provoking the policemen into action  they charged ferociously, dispersing the crowd within minutes. We were at the rear, and managed to escape the dragnet by jumping into the shallow canals around. A few students were bundled into waiting police vans and taken to the Parliament Street police station, where they were detained for some time before being let off.\nThat night, Doordarshan telecast news of protests. My sister-in-law looked at me suspiciously, knowing my proclivity to land in trouble. But the matter didn't go beyond the glance that day. As old-timers will recall, this was only a curtain-raiser: an unprecedented frenzy of student anger was to engulf Delhi for several months. Other participants like me must be nudging the 40-year mark now, and the grind for our daily bread and butter would have long extinguished any revolutionary embers. But every year, about this time, my mind revisits those tumultuous days."}

Patil Stadium here on Wednesday.\nRoss Taylor (31 not out, 30 balls) staged a lone battle as the visitor, chasing 185 for a place in the final, crumbled to 149 for nine in 20 overs. Kieron Pollard was adjudged the Man-of-the-Match.\nSachin Tendulkar was absent owing to injury to fingers from the fourth over onwards in RCB's innings.\nZaheer Khan stepped in to fill the breach. The skipper walked out at the finish to greet each teammate with a bear hug.\nRayudu's efficiency behind the stumps, three wickets by Kieron Pollard apart from a run-out, timely strikes by Harbhajan and J.P. Duminy's well-judged catch on the ropes were the highlights of Mumbai Indians's work on the field. A berth in the Champions League is the first reward.\nRCB's batting response was entrusted to Dravid the opener, orthodox yet effective in using the pace generated by Zaheer Khan. He had the presence of mind to wait for the umpire's verdict when Tendulkar celebrated a catch at first slip. The Mumbai Indians captain walked off for treatment on injured fingers as the television umpire negated the catch.\nHarbhajan's knack of making things happen, complemented by Rayudu's reflexes behind the stumps, resulted in Pietersen's exit. The off-spinner saw the batsman stepping out, bowled down the leg-side and the wicket-keeper finished the task with a flourish, diving sideways to take the bails off.\nUthappa left after a short burst, sweeping sixes off Harbhajan. Mumbai Indians appeared to have turned the tide when a fine piece of fielding by Pollard ran out Dravid (23 runs, 22 balls), collecting a throw from R. Sathish and flinging his body forward to effect a diving run-out, leaving RCB still to get a grip on the chase at the half-way mark (83 for two in 10 overs). Rayudu then latched on to an edge by Kohli.\nRayudu and Saurabh Tiwary, busy as bees earlier at the crease, put on 67 runs off 49 balls in a fifth-wicket stand when the RCB bowlers were on top.\nRayudu started with an imperious drive over the bowler's head, then scored 40 off 38 balls creating the launchpad for the big-hitters to follow.\nTiwary cleared the ball with huge swings, using the bat like a sledgehammer for four sixes.\nMumbai Indians scored 184 for five thanks to a five-over blast from Tiwary and some clean-hitting by Pollard (33 not out off 13 balls).\nThe West Indian smashed three sixes.\nMumbai Indians got a reality check about life without Tendulkar. The captain stretched outside the offstump to drive a Dale Steyn ball swinging away, scooped towards cover for Taylor to stun the home crowd into silence with a low, rolling catch. Kohli's sharp reaction cut short Shikhar Dhawan's short stint as five overs resulted in 39 runs and loss of both the openers.\nDuminy's apprehensions against spin came true, startled by bounce from Kumble.\nRayudu and Tiwary were patient, working the ball around for singles to rotate strike.\nMumbai Indians gained momentum in the 14th over bowled by Kohli.\nThe scores:\nMumbai Indians: S.

There will be more litigation in future when some of the long-suffering people are made aware of their rights, Chief Justice of Madras High Court Ajit Prakash Shah said on Sunday.\nInaugurating a special court to deal with forest offence cases here, he said the cases pending in courts should be cleared at the earliest. This could not be possible without the full co-operation of members of the Bar and the presiding judges. Human hope had its limit, and waiting endlessly was not possible in the modern society. The consumer of justice wanted an unpolluted, expeditious and inexpensive justice. In its absence, the affected person might be tempted to take the law into his hands. So, the judiciary should not allow the people to take recourse to extra-judicial methods to get their grievances redressed. The lack of a speedy dispute resolution mechanism had impacted the level of lawlessness.\nHe said those involved in litigation should not take as a sign of failure of the system but as a sign of faith in the administration of justice. The judiciary could not escape criticism for the number of cases pending, but the executive was also partly responsible.\nThe judge of High Court, R. Banumathi, said the system needed to be re-rationalised and effectively managed to deliver speedy justice. The Government had sanctioned 84 courts during 2007-08.\nThe profession of law was noble and divine calling. It required not only learning but also the sense of social responsibility. An advocate should stand for justice.\nCollector (in charge) B. Jothi Nirmala said steps would be taken to ensure Kanyakumari was free from pollution, as sought by the Chief Justice after he saw polythene bags littered in the railway station. The Government was ready to conduct awareness camps on legal aid and removal of plastic items in which self-help groups would be involved.\nRelated Topics"}

I thought there was something to that,” said Karnad.\nKakar admitted that writing his autobiography A Book of Memory was an exercise in self-exploration and self-deception. “I think that writing an autobiography is about self-examination, about courage to handle the truth about yourself and fight that constant battle between the wish to conceal and the wish to reveal.”\nPerhaps the most important commandment of writing an autobiography is that the narrative should not deal with feelings of self-worth, he said. “It is a constant struggle against narcissism, something which can easily give you a distorted perception of the self.”\nRelated Topics"}

The entire 5 km-stretch has already been levelled.\n“Utmost care is being taken to ensure the quality of the road,” Deputy Commissioner Arvind Srivastav told The Hindu. The bypass was laid about five years ago. The bypass had become inevitable because of the pollution caused by the large number of lorries transporting iron ore from Sandur and Hospet that used to pass through Hospet city. Residents of Hospet had staged dharnas and blocked the movement of heavy vehicles in order to pressure the administration to begin work on the bypass and complete it early.\nBut, with the heavy volume of traffic, the road surface got damaged. Traffic jams had become commonplace. Mr. Srivastav said that Rs. 5 crore more was needed to improve the remaining stretch of the bypass.\nHe said mine owners and industrialists had promised to contribute Rs. 7.4 crore for the purpose.\nRelated Topics"}

From the DMK itself, MP Kanimozhi says they had to pull out of the UPA because the government had failed to ensure changes in a resolution against Sri Lanka moved by the US in the ongoing UN session in Geneva. And from the Tamilar Desiya Iyakkam, a nationalist party, leader P Nedumaran says not puling out would have meant risking isolation from the public at a time when the Lankan Tamil issue has reached such an emotional peak in the state.\nOver the past few weeks, war crimes and human rights violations had resurfaced as a political issue, and coincided with the 22nd session of the UN Human Rights Commission. Major parties had initially demanded that India back the US-moved draft resolution on \"promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka\", then made apparently perfunctory calls for stringent amendments to the resolution.\nWhat changed the complexion of the issue, however, was an indefinite fast by a group of eight students from Loyola College, who demanded India's intervention to give teeth to the resolution. Though the police arrested and removed them after a couple of days, the fast had garnered enough attention to inspire similar protests across various campuses in Tamil Nadu.\nEven while accepting support from all outfits  other than the Congress, they stress  the students remained independent of political leanings. This gave it more credibility than most outfits known for anti-Lanka activism. Soon, students from engineering and medical colleges and even IIT Madras joined the demand for justice for Lankan Tamils. On Tuesday, the Tamil film industry joined the protests.\nIn the beginning, there was criticism of the DMK's passiveness during the last phase of the war when a successful intervention could have saved hundreds of lives. Even the dusk-to-dawn general strike announced by the party's Tamil Eelam Supporters' Organisation a week ago was a moderate success."}

Yet few of us can take on the label of being ‘original’. Adam Grant a professor at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania tells you how to become original (an oxymoron?) and even recognize the true original from the one faking it.\nGrant says, “Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them.”\nThe first point that Grant makes is to do with procrastination, “…we designed some experiments. We asked people to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are. And some of them are asked to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough, the moderate procrastinators are 16 per cent more creative than the other two groups….Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing these experiments, I was starting to write a book about originals, and I thought, ‘This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter on procrastination.’ So I meta-procrastinated, and like any self-respecting procrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate…and one day –– I was halfway through –– I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it, I had all sorts of new ideas. And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal…what about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before the biggest speech of his life, he was up past 3 a.m., rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history: ‘I have a dream.’ That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise…”\nGrant says the originals also suffer from doubt but, “I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt… There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine... And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four. Instead of saying, ‘I'm crap,’ you say, ‘The first few drafts are always crap, and I'm just not there yet’.”\nGrant concludes, “Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they're even more afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science, are the chances not taken.”\nTake time initially and do not be in a hurry to finish your task, doubt your idea to refine it and do not be afraid to take chances…then we can clone many originals!"}

Here, for the record, is the original one:\nExcellency, I write again to bring your attention to the security situation along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir as well as along the working boundary between Pakistan and India, which continues to deteriorate owing to continuing and deliberate unprovoked violations of the ceasefire agreement and cross-border firing by the Indian forces pursuant to the communication from your office that dialogue should be the way forward.\nExcellency, as you are aware, PM Nawaz Sharif went to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in of the newly elected PM as a gesture of good faith and to extend the hand of friendship. After that, coincidentally, all has been downhill for our relationship with India.\nExcellency, even a cursory reading of the Indian media will establish that India’s relationship with Pakistan is driven by elections. To prime J&K for more votes, the BJP-led government cancelled a scheduled meeting between our foreign secretaries. Now, India is going to polls in two states—Maharashtra and Haryana—and the Indian PM has taken to using war-like language, which has allowed India’s mask of good neighbourliness to slip further. Again reports in the Indian media quote Indian PM as saying, “This is not the time for empty boli (talk) by them but for goli (bullets) by our jawans.” This he declared at a rally in Maharashtra after taunting Congress that while it was busy issuing statements, the Indian army had “shut the mouth of Pakistan army”.\nExcellency, the Indian PM is saying this so the BJP profits in the polls. Pakistan has been keeping quiet in the face of such grave provocation because Pakistan is deeply cognisant that India and Pakistan are neighbours and nothing we do will ever change that fact. Even so India not only fired recklessly with heavy mortars but also to taunt us offered Pakistani soldiers sweets without there being even a lull in the firing from the Indian side.\nExcellency, Pakistan is bleeding from a thousand wounds inflicted by Indian guns. We have invited the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan to visit the areas where farmlands have been laid waste by election-inspired firing. We have shown UNMOGIP how Indians have targeted civilians, old women and children —little babies even. The Indians on the other hand are bent on throwing the UNMOGIP out whilst Pakistan extends all facility to UNMOGIP personnel stationed in Pakistan and in the light of unremitting Indian firing, is considering giving them permanent residency near the border areas. At a later stage, Pakistan will confer citizenship to them as well and Pakistan is considering amending rules so we can award deserving UNMOGIP personnel for distinguished service.\nExcellency, Pakistan would like to assure that it has exercised utmost restraint and avoided violating the ceasefire which it is unilaterally observing. It is only the Indians who are firing—both on the Pakistani side as well as their own side—in order to ratchet up tension. Why is India not allowing UNMOGIP to verify this?\nI would be grateful if you could have this circulated as an official document of Security Council.
